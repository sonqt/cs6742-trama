d76clq2_d76eqx3:=:=:=:=What steps can individuals take to prevent attracting animals with food trash, and do you think there should be stricter penalties for littering to deter these behaviors?
d7w24e8_d7wjmpl:=:=:=:=Wow, that's a really ignorant and offensive assumption to make. Accents are not indicative of a person's race, and perpetuating stereotypes like that is harmful and racist.

dlh2z71_dli150y:=:=:=:=Why do you think the intersection between assisted suicide and mental health is such a complex and controversial issue?
dlj826z_dlk84ao:=:=:=:=But the Confederate flag has a long and complex history that has different interpretations depending on the perspective one adopts.
dm5ozao_dm6pmt9:=:=:=:=Do you think there might be misunderstandings or misinterpretations in those conversations you had with your friend?
dm87r1b_dm88etv:=:=:=:=Do you think there are any potential solutions or next steps that could help address these issues within online communities?
