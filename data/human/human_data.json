    "1": "1. It doesn't mean slave.\n\n2. You're already free to use it however you like, in America or in Romania. People in America, who are white, use it all the time. No one is going to jump out of the shadows and arrest you for it.\n\nYou don't, however, get to say \"Well, I decided that its *OK*, and no one else's opinion matters, I'm right\".",

    "6": "But for profit companies are paying for the research to be done. Without that funding, 3/4 of that research isn't happening. Many many people at big pharma companies aren't doing it for profit either. If you asked the scientists and engineers at Lilly, GSK, Pfizer etc why they work the way they do, they will say the same thing as the people at universities.",
    "7": "You don't compare anything to what women go through... you haven't talked about what women go through at all.",
    "8": "Can you link to some of those affidavits? If there are literally hundreds it should be easy for you to find 10 or so.",
    "9": "Oh yes, I'm totally one of the select powerful few, here to argue my point with the plebs on Reddit. Are you high?",
    "10": "&gt;Attacking the opponents identity is exactly ad hominem.\n\nNo it's not. I'm not committing a fallacy if I call you a cunt, since I'm not making an argument at all. An ad hominem would be if I said you were wrong *because* you're a cunt.",

    "18": "Ok. BLM isn't your cup of tea. There are dozens of other orginizations with a similar focus and overlapping goals. Which ones have you supported with your time and money. And what where the specific forms that support took?",
