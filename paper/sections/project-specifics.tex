\section{Course Project Specifics}

\subsection{Project Changes over the Semester}

Over the course of the semester, our project has remained largely consistent.
Our overall research goal of understanding how SOTA models use conversational context in making predictions has not changed.
However, we were able to refine our research questions as we progressed.
In particular, whether these models need to use context, and whether these models actually use context, are distinct questions that we distilled from our overarching research goal.

\subsection{Individual Contributions}
Son was primarily responsible for running the model evaluations. 
Austin and Vivian were primarily responsible for trying ChatGPT prompts to use, as well as designing and running the human annotations.
All three team members contributed equally to the presentations and writing of the paper.
