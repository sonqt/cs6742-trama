\section{Data}

This project uses the CGA datasets.
This consists of two separate datasets: Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV) and Wikipedia talk pages~\citep{chang-danescu-niculescu-mizil-2019-trouble,zhang-etal-2018-conversations}.
The CGA-CMV dataset consists of $20,576$ conversations from the CMV subreddit.
A conversation is considered to go awry if it eventually has a comment removed by a moderator for violating Rule 2 of the subreddit: "Don't be rude or hostile to other users."
The CGA-Wiki dataset consists of $4,188$ conversations from Wikipedia talk pages.
The conversations were labeled by crowdworkers as either containing a personal attack or staying calm throughout.
