It would be similar to saying the south shouldn't be helped when it floods or the midwest when strong winds damage parts of their property.  \n\nNow in California the shortage of water for residents is sort of man-made as (80% of all of the water) is used to support the rest of the nation in growing food, milk, feed, and plants. California produces more agriculture than any other state and a number of products exclusive for the entire country. Most residents have already cut down to minimums. To OPs point, the state shouldn't really be punishing residents for using a very minimal amount of water which maintains their property as they bought it prior to the drought/national emergency.  To my point the Federal government should either find more water to distribute to California, Oregon, and Washington or contribute funds to purchasing outside water and that should be subsidizing the agriculture not individuals effectively selling their lawns that probably cost about $2000 or more each which would've been sustainable had this drought not been the most severe.

The problem with your analogy is that hands are used constantly, all day every day. There are many uses for them. Guns on the other hand (pun intended) have a very limited range of uses. \n\nI think you lost track of your line of logic here.\n\nYou said:\n&gt;I'll only support this if long rifles are taxed at half the rate of fists, since fists and feet are used to commit twice as many homicides per year as rifles.\n\nInsurance rates are determined by a number of factors with probably the most important being the likelihood the user will make a claim.\n\n If we are applying this to the difference between guns and fists we need to look at more than the total murders. We need to look at the number of owners compared to the number of claims.\n\n100% of americans own hands. Only 30% of americans own any kind of gun. I would assume the vast majority of those people own a handgun but lets keep the 30% just as an example. Even if 30% of Americans owned a rifle (which the number is far lower than that), that puts us at 1 in 412,000 chance that someone owns a fist and will use them to murder and a  1 in 309,000 chance that they own a rifle and will use it.

Yes you could still buy one illegally but that is more dangerous so the prices would go up and availabillity down. The main issue is culture. As long as there is a gun culture there will be guns everywhere along with gun deaths. If the assault rifle is the ferrari of guns then banning the high end will decrease the level of gun culture and allow for a change in how people view guns which hopefully will trickle down to handgun ownership and decrease the total amount of guns which will decrease the gun related deaths. You can buy guns in europe but because there is no gun culture there are relatively few privately owned guns and also relatively few gun related deaths. That is the direction the USA should head in unless they see gun ownership as more important than risk of getting shot. That is the debate right now.",

You can talk about this in terms of Darwinism which is I guess where they're coming from here, but we don't leave disabled people to die for the same reason I don't think eating meat is right - It's unnecessarily cruel.\n\nIt means that we need high quality proteins to sustain our body expenditures. The moment where animals started to eat meat, is the moment where large and quality brains and skeletal structure started to form. Suddenly the mammals didn't have to spend all the  time eating to sustain such a massive body and brain and be literally prey for others.\n\nTalking about prey. The hunting of animals is another benchmark for humans (well ancient animal like ancestors of humans). Once we started eating meat, we had to start hunt for food. That means we had to adapt to run fast, be strong and most importantly be clever.\n\nSome herbivores are by leagues faster than carnivores. Which offcourse means we needed to use our brains to kill them. Starting to form packs, cornering the animals, using tools to hunt for the animals, etc... None of our society would be possible if we didn't hunt animals. \n\n&gt;It's a way to control the population of animals\" - I'm not incredibly well researched on this, but I'm almost certain that the population of animals we eat is down to the fact that there's a high demand for their meat, not the other way around. And even if that was wrong, literally eating them seems a bit of a strange solution.\n\nAs twisted as it sounds. Us eating animals is ensuring strong and steady population of those animals. Think about animals that are going to go extinct and then tell me how many of those animals are we actively eating? The only thing I can think of are whales specific to Pacific\n\n&gt;\"It's what we've always done\" - Literally not an argument. Until 100 years ago we hadn't figured out basic hygiene standards in hospitals.\n\nLet's formulate it bit better. Our genes developed before the agricultural revolution. Our bodies are literally programed to function effectively on the diet consisting of meat. Problems such as diabetes, heart problems, obesity wasn't an issue until we started to grow crops, process sugar and salt. Our body simply doesn't work in an optimal way to adjust for those factors as of yet.\n\nFurthermore people who don't eat meat are at higher risk of having various mental issues, by having a chemical imbalance in brain. (Body does not know how to properly adjust if meat is not included in your diet)\n\nNot to mention various other problems. Such as narcolepsi, insomnia, weakened and imparired senses, and other problems that arise if you don't have enough sustained long-lasting energy that our body build specifically from meat. Etc, etc... So better way to phrase this criticism would be.\n\nBecause our body doesn't know how to function properly without meat.\n\nOkay, so why should we eat meat now. In todays world, where we don't really NEED meat to survive. You can get all the esentials without meat. But you need to do a proper research. You need to carefully eat things that give you the most ammount of quality protein, and you should also have special food supplements to avoid the vast majority, if not all the problems you get from not eating meat.\n\nBut, and this is a big but. Eating meat is still the most optimal way to get yourself into the best health you can possibly have. Which is the single most important thing you have.\n\n",

That, on the face of it alone, does not necessarily mean that the perspective given in the article is biased or skewed, but at the very least one should probably keep that in mind and approach the article critically. The article (and you) frame the situation in terms of this being about equality and freedom to both congregate and express one's self. This is all done in the rhetoric of social justice--e.g. the school is discriminating--and a benign rhetoric describing the men's group--calling it a \"men's issue\" group or calling it \"anti-feminist.\" My guess, if I am trusting the judgment of the school, is not that this was merely a support group for men and they denied them the status of an official group on this basis, but they are something closer to a hate group like the red pill and that was the primary reason for denial. Would you also object if something like a white supremacist group--similarly dressed up nicely of course in sheep's clothing--wanted the same status but was denied? I don't think it is unreasonable to deny club status to a white supremacist group. I don't know if this is actually the case here as I haven't looked at it past the link you gave.

It isn't always about fairness, it sometimes has to be about social cohesion and doing what is best for the human race as a whole.  My biggest fear would be that this would incentivize men to relinquish their responsibility to use birth control.  There would be absolutely no downside for them.  It is also a rule that would be completely unenforceable unless a man signed a contract prior to engaging in sex with a female, and I doubt this is practical or that many women would agree with this.  The stakes are just too high to risk it.   The whole thing becomes a big mess legally and turns into he said, she said.  I could totally picture unethical men pressuring women to have sex without birth control promising they will be there if something happens and then backing out when the reality sits in.\n\nNow I agree that this sucks for men, but I don't really see a workable alternative that would make sure societies children are provided for.  My honest hope is that in the future, we improve on birth control and even come up with a \"default\" method that makes us only able to have children if we actively choose to.  However, reality is that right now, we have to do the best we can to support children that are \"accidentally\" born.  ",

Yes, XYZ privilege might be a result of white people having been in this country for multiple generations without repression and it's not the fault of white people today that other groups didn't have the same access before.

This last bit, that he's a narcissist, means that other people are tools to him.  The only thing that matters to him is himself, and he believes that the world ought to revolve around *him*.\n\nOther people are sociopaths or psychopaths -- you should study this a bit to understand how these people work -- and they're even worse.  While narcissists treat people as nothing more than tools in order to gain their admiration, they genuinely want to be liked.  Psychopaths, on the other hand, treat people as nothing more than playthings.  They will think nothing about murdering you if they can get away with it, just to experience what it's like to murder someone.  They usually have high charisma and are expert manipulators, enabling them to get other people to do their dirty work when it suits them.  Donald Trump is narcissist, which means that he's absolutely not good, but he will do good if it will make him more popular (this is one of the reasons why I'm not that concerned about his upcoming presidency).  Psychopaths are *far* worse.  An appeal to basic human decency might actually work on a narcissist; the psychopath will simply enjoy watching you beg before completely destroying you in the most painful way possible.\n\nMost people aren't evil, but they'll likely only be altruistic within their ingroup -- outsiders are not welcome.  This is human nature, grown from the need for tribalism in the jungles or whatever; if you let outsiders take your tribe's stuff, your tribe won't have any stuff left.  This is why it's so easy to get racism and similar kinds of bigotry (hatred against Mexican immigrants, Muslims, whatever); bigotry against outsiders is human nature, and yes, it's based on appearance because that's what we have to go by, cognitively.  You can argue that these people aren't actually evil, but I wouldn't make that argument.  (The Nazis were just trying to obtain living space for themselves, right?)  Still, let's say ignore bigotry as a category.  Most people are actually fundamentally good, like you say.  Again, wishing for the welfare of your own tribe is human nature, just like wishing evil upon outsiders is also human nature.  But narcissists, sociopaths, psychopaths, etc. are *not* fundamentally good people, and they were born that way.",

One example since the election is his flip-flop on his promise to prosecute Hillary Clinton for her use of a personal email server.  Aside from a few angry tweets, there is definitely not a mass abandonment from his supporters.  \n \nSo this begs the question: why did they vote for him?  I could give you guesses, but you'd be better off asking them yourself.  I think they saw him as a change from the status quo who would force some kind of change to the way things operate in Washington.  I don't personally agree, but like I said, you'd learn more talking to them. \n \nI was as shocked by the election results as anyone else, and one of the first things I figured out is that I really should have spent less time on FiveThirtyEight.com and more time actually talking to the Trump supporters I know on Facebook.  It's true, some of them have completely abhorrent positions, but others are more reasonable, including a friend of mine who has been affected by rising costs under the ACA.\n \nIf you dismiss close to half the country as pure evil, then you're never going to learn anything about why they voted the way the did.

They like their simple, comfortable world with bad guys and good guys. Many democrats have a myopic and simplistic view of the world too, but it is less erroneous (anti-GMO/vaccine/nuclear zealots notwithstanding).\n\nAfter spending years arguing with leftists on reddit, I can tell you that the vast majority of them have a view of the world that is almost entirely based on emotional pleas, baseless assertions and sometimes prejudice against white people, old people, rich people, or republicans.\n\n&gt;A depressing amount of republicans hate liberals and educated people such as university professors. They refuse to believe that higher learning truly is valuable and do not accept that the \"liberal elites\" are more qualified to make policies than they are.\n\nWhat republicans hate is elitism. They hate a few people confidently imposing rules from the top down on millions of people. Universities have become a pretty strong figurehead for that, and for liberal elitism in general, with professors being wildly leftwing. If you don't believe that liberal policies work, why would you believe liberal elites are more qualified to make policies? Isn't that the issue? That they don't agree with them?\n\n&gt;Not only that, but they resent and despise those more literate and informed than they are and care more about settling imaginary scores with their caricatural views of them than anything else.\n\nRepublicans are probably not interested enough in intellectualism, and liberals are far far far too obsessed with the appearance of it. What matters is if the ideas are better, and so far none of what you're saying is about ideas. You're just attacking people with vague insults.\n\n&gt;A substantial amount of republicans AND, to a lesser degree, democrats cannot distinguish between baseless smears/fake news and facts.\n\nBecause they've been basically locked out by a media and academia that are left leaning beyond normalcy given the general population and beyond what is reasonable to conclude about the issues. Where do you want them to go when the \"credible\" and \"official\" channels are either lying to them, or giving them propaganda, or at best giving them a liberal-biased version of whatever it is they're telling them?\n\n&gt;Republican politicians are in the pockets of the wealthy and truly do not care if the poor die in the street or if the middle class is destroyed. Their behavior is evil by their own moral standards. Only the rich and their immediate family and friends truly matter to them.\n\nI mean come on. Are you even being serious here? You're assigning motive to people you know nothing about. I'm waiting for where in your post you actually make *arguments* instead of slinging hyperbolic insults with nothing to back it up.\n\n&gt;Over 33% of the population are willing to tolerate racism as long as it's not aimed at them. This number percentage is significantly higher amongst white people.\n\nCan you provide a source for this? I'm having trouble understanding what point you're trying to make. It seems very contrived and not really relevant. It wouldn't surprise me if white people care less about racism in general than minority groups.\n\n&gt;the election of Donald Trump.\n\nwhich is a result of posts like this.\n\n&gt;the inexorable economic decline of industrial rural america.\n\nWhich is due to technology and automation, none of the insults you just made about republicans.\n\n&gt;the countless comments and insults I've seen hurled at liberals (liberals don't have equivalents to libtard or cuck or behavior such as \"rolling coal\").\n\nYou just wrote a huge post dedicated to calling republicans racists and stupid. And if you think leftwing phrases like that don't exist, go visit /r/politics\n\n&gt;Vote tallies for Donald Trump, who has made countless racist, sexist and bigoted comments, exhibited racism in a documented fashion (housing discrimination).\n\nAnother example of republicans being less likely to care about the appearance of these things. Donald trump was an extremely unliked candidate, even when he was elected. This says that republicans voted for him pragmatically, despite those things. Maybe you think saying stupid shit should automatically disqualify you no matter what, but obviously people disagree with you. That doesn't make them racist, sexist or bigoted.\n\n&gt;People who vote republican despite the fact it is factually against their own interest (repealing obamacare, tax cuts for the rich are harmful according to the CBO).\n\nDo you not get the irony? You are the *perfect* example of what they hate. You just said that repealing obamacare is factually against their interest. How in the fucking **world** do you call that a fact? How in the fucking **world** are you going to claim it's a fact that cutting taxes (for basically everybody) is going to be against their own interest. You realize the CBO is only looking at the *budget*, right? That it's not looking at all possible direct and indirect effects of having a low tax, low regulation environment? This is a great example of what's wrong with the left's obsession with the appearance of facts and intellectualism. The CBO has numbers, and numbers are good! Therefore if the CBO says something bad about something, it's a FACT that it's bad.

This autistic person can see and feel music. They can live and breathe a work of art. They have such passion for their special interest that they learn for the sake of learning, and invent for the sake of sharing what they made. The autistic person takes so long to answer questions because they learned to be as sensitive, clear, and deliberate as possible, and they don't sacrifice that for sloppiness.\n\nThe autistic person is also left handed. Writing in binders is annoying and writing with pencils leaves graphite smudged across their hand. School desks don't support their dominant arm, and the only scissors available always make their hand cramp.\n\nThey take tennis lessons though, and have an innate advantage over everyone else in the class. They tend to be more creative and intelligent than their peers. \n\nThey have as much to look forward to as anyone else, but society builds things for right handed people, and society builds things for non-autistic people.\n\nShould they never have been born?",

The only \"adventure\" you're missing out on is the potential to fuck more people, and even then marriage doesn't necessarily stop that either (1/20 marriages are open).  All you really miss out on is the anticipation game... \"This could be the night.\"  It's the hunt, and the dumb shit you do for (usually bad) casual sex.  \n\nThere's literally nothing about life in your 20's that you also can't experience being married.  I went skydiving in Hawaii as a 25 year-old married man, then we island-hopped over to Molokai and slept on the beach for two days.  I went to the original Hoffbrauhaus in Germany for Oktoberfest at age 27.  On the same trip, I was chased down the streets by an angry hooker in Amsterdam. And my wife was right there by my side through all of it.  It's not like we have kids, we're free to do these things whenever conditions allow, and being married doesn't impact that whatsoever.\n\nAlso, the goal of marriage isn't to lock in somebody as they are at any given moment.  When you're at the point where you want to marry, you already know that.  They're *going* to change, regardless of age.  20 year-old me is different from 37 year-old me, sure.  And 37 year-old me will change by age 50.  And 50 year-old me will change by age 65.  Nothing about marrying at an older age mitigates those kinds of changes.  *The whole point* is that you believe in the core goodness of the person you're with and you want to be there to see all those changes first-hand.\n\nI got married at age 24, my wife at 21.  We're now 37 and 34.  Not a single missed adventure between us... In fact, our support for each other has *enabled* far more than either of us would engage in by ourselves.  ",

Are you talking about chromosomes?  If so, what about chromosomes should relate to the outcomes you're talking about?\n\n&gt;  Thinking and learning about those specific issues is where I began to encounter, and become suspicious of, the concept of gender identity. Essentially, my objection is as follows: when constructing their identity, people should ignore, as best they can, concepts of gender, and instead base their sense of self solely upon their tastes, beliefs, traits, etc.\n\nWait, this last sentence contradicts itself.  For instance, I like pink.  That's feminine.  Do you think I shouldn't have any opinion whatsoever about pink, because liking pink is a gendered trait?  \n\nI'm also confused about this idea of \"constructing\" an identity.

DNA can be described as male if it contains the XY chromosomes, and as female if it contains the XX chromosomes. \n\n\"If so, what about chromosomes should relate to the outcomes you're talking about?\"\nSome of the connections are relatively simple, some are quite complex. I don't claim to know what all the connections are, or how strong they are. But the fact that some connection exists is pretty hard to dispute. One of the clearer, less controversial types of connections: DNA determines what sex hormones you are shaped by. These hormones have a profound effect upon development and personality. For example, a strong causal connection has been shown to exist between testosterone levels and aggressiveness. Aggressiveness is typically viewed as a masculine trait, thus DNA has some impact upon at least one gendered trait. \n\n\"Wait, this last sentence contradicts itself. For instance, I like pink. That's feminine. Do you think I shouldn't have any opinion whatsoever about pink, because liking pink is a gendered trait?\"\nNo. I think that you shouldn't feel any obligation to like or dislike pink because of your gender, nor should any others push you to like or dislike pink because of your gender. \nAnd I don't see the contradiction.\n\n\"I'm also confused about this idea of \"constructing\" an identity. Identities are in large part constructed for you: we're social, and a large part of who we are is how other people see and treat us. Could you explain what you mean here and how this fits into the social nature of identity?\"\nI'll do my best. First off, I'm sort of using something like a shorthand when I talk about identity and its formation, because it would take too long to fully describe those two things.\nOur identities are constructed around our tastes and experiences. Our interactions with other people make up a huge part of our experiences, and they influence our tastes, so yes, our interactions with people have great impact upon our identities. Part of what I was getting at is that people should do their best not to enforce gender roles.\nWe can also influence our own sense of self, however, and again, when doing so, it would be best if we did so in accordance with our own preferences and in pursuit of our own goals, rather than in alignment with the arbitrary concepts of gender.

This study (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/) states that 90% of people who attempt suicide fail their attempt *and go on to die by natural non-suicide causes*. If the vast majority of people attempting suicide change their minds and go on to lead long, fulfilling lives, why would we want to improve their ability to succeed at the initial attempt?\n\n&gt; traumatise others\n\nWhat makes you think the assisted suicide wouldn't be traumatic for others? I understand this would remove the chance of, say, a loved one finding the dead body. But regardless, it's easy to imagine a mother being traumatized that some institutionalized company killed her 22 year old son. \n\nWhere would these assisted killings occur? Would a private company offer them? That leads to all kinds of moral gray areas and conflicts of interest, to have a private company incentivized by profit off helping people (people who are *categorically* \"unstable\" and therefore prone to be exploited) die. Or would it be at a public hospital? I am sure that the family of a 22 year old who kills himself despite their objections would find it extremely traumatic to have to visit said hospital.\n\ntl;dr - I think my first point (that we shouldn't help people commit suicide because most people fail and then recover) is the most important, but my secondary points (i.e., even your proposed idea would create trauma, and would open up new moral gray areas with perverse incentives) help chip away at this view as well. \n",

Obviously if you or one of your friends was raped, and you knew the friend well enough to highly doubt the possibility that they're faking it, means that your obviously going to call for the rapist to be locked up immediately. But that sentiment doesn't affect how the court runs. \n\n2. When you're accused of being a sexual predator, like being accused of any crime, you're going to lose friends and support. But people who know you are thinking about more than just this one court case, getting accused of certain crimes might tarnish your reputation, but many men who get accused of rape already have bad reputations. Look at bill cosby, when he was accused no one came out and said it's all untrue I know bill personally and he's a great guy who respects women. Pretty much everyone around him knew and believed the rumors based on what they already knew about his character. Although this might not seem fair and it does hurt the few men who are falsely accused of being rapists but were already fairly misogynistic. But the fact is, and this is a fact, false rape accusations go to court about as much as every false accusation goes to court. So despite what MRA's claim, there isn't a hoard of innocent men behind bars because of angry feminists denying the truth.\n\n3. Women repeatedly get treated with skepticism when they come forward with their story. Most women refuse to go to the police for this reason. But very very few women lie about something as terrible as rape. So if your close friend says she was raped, and you say \"prove it' that's a shitty thing to do. Coz no one is on trial yet, more than justice rape victims want support. But they also very rightly want justice, many believe that they can't get it. \n\n4. Women who don't want to come forward with their experience far out weigh women falsely accusing innocent men. It's more important to encourage women to come forward than to punish women who might be lying. Not to mention that perjury and giving a false statement is illegal and always will be.\n\nThe fact is that men facing false accusations is a problem and does lead to negative consequences obviously. However if they have a good reputation they can get through it and often won't lose all their friends, and they almost definitely won't go to prison unless there is fake evidence. Where as women still face the far far larger threat of sexual assault and lack of legal option in the aftermath. Not to mention the social pressure to not make a fuss. Both of this things are problems but the latter is far more endemic and should have most of our focus. ",

Law-abiding people will turn in their guns, manufacturers will have to stop making and selling. As criminals are arrested, more guns will be removed from the system, their supply will start drying up. Some family members will rat out remaining owners.  As now-criminal gun-owners die, some of their heirs will turn in the guns.

            "text": "I'll let others continue to address your main point, but I'd like to push back on your statement that \"guns should't be seen as the go to self-defense method, martial arts should be.\" \n \n \nLet me preface this by saying that I am a 26 year old army vet who's trained a bit(not competitively) in MMA, and the Army's Combatives program. I am in pretty good shape, strong, and I can hit relatively hard. \n   \n   \nThat being said, the idea that someone, healthy or otherwise, could expect to RELY on hand to hand combat skills to defend themselves and their family in the real world is unbelievably naive. There is a reason police have various tools available to them with escalating levels of force. This is because there are uncontrollable variables. Number, size, strength, skill, determination, and intent of the opponents, weapons, whether you are defending only yourself or your partner or children, the list goes on. Hand combat skills are only useful in a small minority of these situations. A firearm however, is a great equalizer. Facing 4 NFL lineman sized motherfuckers intent on raping your wife? The Glock on your hip is the only hope you've got of stopping that. I don't care how many times you've seen karate kid. \n    \n    \nMOST IMPORTANTLY, firearms carried by law abiding citizens have the potential to end potentially harmful or deadly situations BEFORE THE SITUATION EVEN STARTS. In the above example, if you draw a firearm on those guys, the entire situation likely ends without a pull of the trigger. The mere THREAT of deadly force is sufficient to stop most opponents and hold them until police can arrive. If you had tried to fight them off, best case scenario, the police arrive quickly enough that you've just been battered a bit and nothing too awful happened....but you(the victim) still got hurt.\n    \n   \nI will partially accept part of the notion you mentioned when you stated that \"Well the 90yo women in a wheel chair needs to realize that a gun won't either. Like I said, by the time she draws it and cocks it, she's dead unless the person attacking her is also a 90yo woman.\"\n    \n    \nIf we have accepted the fact that deadly force could be imparted on you very rapidly (regardless of your age), what in the world makes you think that your ability punch, kick, or grapple with any proficiency would be useful at all? The answer is, it wouldn't be. There is no true defense against deadly force applied correctly. If the potential for deadly force exists however, but isn't applied instantly (ie pre-planned assassination) then a firearm MAY be useful for defense. \n    \n  \nWhere martial arts would be effective and useful is against non-lethal force (think bar fight with non-armed opponent). This is a situation where even a law abiding citizen would not be justified in utilizing their firearm for defense so there is certainly value to having the hand-to-hand skills.\n   \nLook, I wish we lived in a world where firearms were not needed, but we don't. Something similar to my above example happened a mile from my house not that long ago. A young woman was at home in her apartment, 2 big dudes shattered the glass porch door, came in, and raped her. You think martial arts could have stopped that? Not a snowflake's chance in hell. \n    \nA former roommate of mine in college prevented a robbery of our home(and potential bodily injury to himself) with his firearm. It was late at night and someone walked right in the front door. My roommate said \"What the fuck are you doing?\" To which the intruder repled \"Fuck you\" and continued to enter. Roommate stood up, drew his firearm, and the intruder ran. \n    \nAnother man I know got into a shootout in his home with intruders and killed 2 of them, saving the lives of his wife and 2 children. Made front page of the newspaper. \n    \nSo yeah, guns aren't good defense tools...right. ",

Even apart from mocking caricatures. \n\nOrientalism was popular at the time. Negro spirituals were collected as idle curiosities. The Treasures of Africa were showed around in World Fairs, to amazed onlookers. People have always had a desire to learn about other cultures.

People ate up Karl May's cowboys vs. indians adventure stories, and Kipling's portrayal of India, and various others using \"exotic\" settings. \n\nThere has never been a realistic threat, that if we are too nitpicky about this time not doing cultural interaction *that way*, but try to be more respectful, then suddenly we will manage to *invent cultural segregation*.

In an age where straight or white people are discriminated against equally, or even more than gay and colores people, why is the idea of being proud of being straight or white so abhorrent. I\u2019m not proposing a straight pride movement, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any pride to be had in any sexuality or race. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that the movement exists due to the intolerance against gay or colored people, when clearly there is more or the same amount of intolerance towards straight and white people.

            "text": "Dan Savage has consistently said two things on this topic, either of which might at least give you another perspective.\n\nFirst can be found in this [column from 2012](https://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14850048), where Dan notes that these types of parades clearly haven't set the LGBT community back too much, considering that they've been occurring in major cities for many years and these communities have never been stronger. Cities with the biggest parades are often the most accepting, although granted this may be flipping correlation and causation.\n\nThe other point Dan has made is pretty simple: the \"freaks\" were the ones that supported the gay and trans community from day one. Straight swingers, sadists, and masochists were among the first to rally behind the gay cause, even though it probably hurt their own political cause in doing so. To an extent, the LGBT community \"owes\" some support and some gratitude for people who stuck with them in removing sodomy laws and eventually legalizing gay marriage in the US. The crazy stuff in some parades is sort of a salute to this past, a way to let that freak flag fly and be accepting of all, even if it's quite offensive to even fairly accepting people. If you drop the allies from the parade, you're sort of turning your back on your staunchest advocates.\n\nI sort of agree with you, personally: I have a lot of conservative family members who would be freaked out by some sections of the parade and I'm a bit of a prude myself. In my mind though, it sort of sets a new benchmark for what's \"freaky\" and suddenly a person who likes to swing both ways doesn't seem so weird. Consider the [\"door-in-the-face technique\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique) which you sometimes see in sales. When you ask someone to accept something really crazy, which they'll recoil from or clearly reject, you can then more readily present them another option, which is less extreme, and they'll be more likely to accept it. It's a little underhanded in a way, but it's not really a trick, just an argumentative technique.",

With this comes this message that women are inherently sexual beings that lead men to desire and that they're in danger if they show themselves to men, even in a non sexual way. It's genuinely believed that men must avert their eyes so as not to feel sexually interested in this. It's not a choice, because from the get go, it's been an insistence. You see kids wearing a niqab. You occasionally see them wearing a hijab. \n\nWhereas high heels admittedly do carry a negative message, but it's worth considering that it's a negative message largely created by the market for high heels. It started out being a thing that men did. Now it's a thing that women do. And it's largely now a problem that women do it, rather than an insistence by men that women do it. It's like makeup. If women were to refuse to wear makeup, then it's quite likely that there would not be serious consequences for it from men. But the issue is that an individual woman is caught in this system whereby women wear makeup and judge others who do not wear makeup. \n\nI don't know of men that insist that women must wear makeup or wear heels or whatever. And to some extent, my parents refuse to give my sisters makeup and let them wear heels and indeed shun social media until such time as it's judged appropriate and when that is exactly, I don't know. The idea that they're sexual beings is explained to girls when it's appropriate and is done so in a more honest way.  And to some extent everyone's parents do this.

Oppressive means \"unjustly inflicting hardship and constraint, especially on a minority or other subordinate group.\" Heels are worn almost worn exclusively by women and objectively can damage one's physical health which is why I consider it \"oppressive\" \n\nI know many women chose to where heels but also many women where them due to societal pressure or social norms t that they've had since birth especially for formal events which is similar to the niqab imo. \n\nI will concede from arguments for families where they do where the niqab it is probably more pressured to do so.

The feeling I got was that their main concern was about pointing out what they saw as injustice in the legal system.\n\n\n&gt;The black lives matter movement has heightened the anti-police sentiment that I grew up with as a child.\n\nI think they would see it differently. I imagine that many in the movement would argue that the hostility faced by many black people go unnoticed. Arguments like this don't seem to really want \"peace\" so much as \"quiet\".\n\nWhile I think the comparison is appropriate, others may not. So, not to compare the motivations behind these movements, but I'll try draw parallels between responses to perceived injustices. Many opponents to the Civil Rights Movement of the 50s and 60s, many felt that the reactions of the black community were just stirring up trouble. \n\n&gt;their efforts to raise \"awareness\" has obfuscated what normal (and I believe good) police interactions look like.\n\nI think this sentence might demonstrate a fundamental philosophical difference that you might have with their efforts. The argument of good cops vs bad cops ignores the structural norms of law enforcement. The existence of the so-called \"blue wall of silence\" and so-called \"good cops'\" maintenance of it sort of disqualifies them to claim such a title doesn't it?

Second, again, I think they would argue that it has, for quite some time, been them (law enforcement) vs black folks.\n\n&gt;It may be true that the police want \"quiet\" not \"peace\" (I've never really thought of it this way). But I think that this is very different from the civil rights movements because now we actually do have the power to put pressure on the people who are making these laws and policies which are creating the injustices we see.\n\n...\n\n&gt;I think we need sit ins at town meetings and speech givers who can rally everybody to the polling booths where we elect individuals who are going to work to erase systemic racism.\n\nI think it's important to point out something that comes up a lot in legal/social science discussions, and that is the difference between de jure (by law) and de facto (in actual fact.) So, for instance, prior to the passing of the voting rights act, black people did have the right to vote. If they passed a literacy test, a constitutional test (which had such obscure legal questions on it, very few could have ever passed.), paid a poll tax, etc. So, in that way, the argument could have been made that post emancipation, black people have always had the right to vote. But in actual fact, the way jim crow laws were structured, the barrier to entry was almost impossible to overcome. With the way congressional districts are gerrymandered, the ability to bring about change electorally is also very difficult. Also, the idea that we can just vote in someone else, suggests that there are people to run. Of course, in order to get elected, you have to be nominated, and as we just saw in New York's 14th District, or during the 2016 election, party establishments are very uncomfortable with the idea of political change.\n\n\n&gt;I don't think we need marches that shut down highways and riots in the streets.\n\nSpectacle is a main element of protest, the same was said of MLK during the 60s, and again, I'm not equating motives here, merely tactics.\n\n&gt;I don't think we can shame the police into changing.\n\nIt's not a matter of shaming police, again, it's about raising awareness, through cell phone camera footage, and other methods, about the disproportionate levels of violence used by police when confronting a perceived threat. John Crawford III was shot for walking around with a BB gun in a walmart in Ohio, which is an open carry state.\n\n&gt;Could you list any positives things that BLM has accomplished that has actually made a difference ? Part of my issue is that I don't see that they've made any progress I just see things getting worse. \n\nWhat i think is important to point out here is that movements like this take a long time, especially when they are trying to combat something so structural. The Civil Rights movement is said to have started in 1955 with the killing of Emmett Till, and went all the way to 1968. I'm reminded of a quote credited to Gandhi that goes, \"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\" I can't say for sure where Black Lives Matter is in this process, Probably somewhere between stage two and three, but again, efforts like this take time. That being said, if you want tangible changes, more and more police departments are instituting policies that demand the use of body cameras which, while I don't think it's enough, it is a start. Sometimes, bringing something to light that was, up until then, not widely acknowledged is progress in itself. Imagine what would have happened if Walter Scott's killing was not recorded, and that recording did not surface, showing the partner of the cop who killed him planting a taser near Scott's dead body. Their report that he stole the taser and then ran would have been accepted as fact. Every small step taken in a particular direction is still a step taken.",

Likewise, contractors nowadays get paid per job- squeezing in around 50 a day- rather than being paid on if they actually help the customer.\n\nThis is true.  \n\nBut because of capitalism, tool makers have incentive to provide good, affordable tools that do the job efficiently.  Contractors decide which tool is best for the job and weigh the cost/benefit - maybe this one costs more, but it's more effective.  Maybe a simple hammer is all I need here.\n\nOf course the tool company wants to make money, but they do that through innovation and quality.\n\nSure, a contractor can do shoddy work, but word will get around and no one will want to use them.\n\nDo you really think that if there was a Government Tool Board that directed manufacturers what tools to make and what innovations are best that we'd have better tools that we currently do?\n\nIf not, then why would pharma be better?",

Another case is a woman \u201creporting her concerns\u201d about a man in the dressing room who claimed to identify as a woman.\n\nSo their data is suspect on the face of it and blurs the lines between \u201csexual predators\u201d and people who are just transgendered and want to use the bathroom.  That\u2019s without even getting into the methodology problems of just listing a bunch of incidents consistent with your point as \u201cevidence\u201d that transgendered-policies encourage assault.\n\nThe point here is that actual data is irrelevant to their argument.

I wouldn't have running water or sewers without taxes, no electricity or gas. I think we can all agree that life is better with these things. The issue comes up when you decide what is necessary and where the line should be drawn. A society will never agree on how much should be spent for what, so the democratic system aims to provide some relief in this fashion by allowing the people a voice.    \n\nThis system is deeply deeply flawed but it works on a certain level. The biggest issue as I see it, is that there is no opt-out option. Every piece of land the whole world over is claimed by some government that requires you to follow their rules. You can't just move out into the wild and build yourself a cabin unless you first buy the land, and you can't earn money without paying taxes on it. Your best option then is to work for many years paying taxes along the way before you can opt out. This seems a fair arrangement because you are still enjoying many benefits of the government including safety from foreign invaders, the rule of law to protect your property, the roads and bridges that allow you to travel, infrastructure that allowed you to buy a vehicle.    \n\nI guess in the end, if you don't like taxes, and don't want to pay them, you can partially opt out by not paying income taxes, but you won't be able to escape property taxes, or sales taxes. You can't opt out immediately and it seems a fair trade-off for the services you enjoyed along the way and will continue to enjoy in a society. Is taxation theft? No, taxation is taxation, that's why there's a word for it. Can it be seen as unfair? absolutely, but you can't overlook the benefits if you want to make that argument.",

But let's set this aside.  \n\n\nYou take the racial IQ gap as a prominent example. That topic has been discussed from virtually every angle. The only thing that has been widely disqualified is a primarily genetic reason because it has been disproven by virtually every transracial adoption study on the topic. In the meantime, there's an avid discussion about the specific non-genetic reason for this IQ gap. Is it socioeconomic, as many Marxist scholars would argue? Is it based on sociocultural factors like racism? Can it be boiled down to geographic reasons as statisticians tried to figure out ircc? Maybe it's a mix of all that and many intersectional scholars say exactly that.  \n\n\nAnd at that point, your background comes important. If you're saying \"They all say it's racism!\" it's objectively wrong and I would need to know where there's a gap in your knowledge to address it. Maybe you see the humanities as monolithic and don't know there's a variety of voices from postcolonial scholars to feminist scholars to Postmodernists or psychoanalytical/Freudian scholars and Marxist scholars. And that variety of voices hasn't gotten smaller over the last years. Or maybe you take offense that studies focus not enough on genetics. In that case, I'd have to lay out why genetics as a root for many of those societal problems has been ruled out in a very consistent, logical and widely accepted way. ",

The study is impartial. The conclusion and method are peer reviewed.  The conclusion is the conclusion.   You say you would be happy to have it prove something, but that has been done as close as it can be.  Do another study!  If the methods are sound and peer reviewed, the conclusion is the conclusion. \n\nWhen are you willing to accept it?  Would you like to also have an open academic debate about the world being flat?

You're cutting off a part of the human body that has a definite and useful purpose\n2. (The more applicable one to my later argument against your CMV) - babies DO feel pain (believe it or not many don't understand this), and forcibly cutting the most sensitive part of your body when you're less than a day old is arguably pretty barbaric.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow - if you're a man and you have the balls to watch a video of the procedure, it's pretty impossible to not cringe, moan, and grab your dick just to make sure it's doing ok. But for the most part, men don't make this decision for their sons. Women do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Women\\* tend to prefer circumcised dicks - because they \"don't look as weird.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a very important part of this movement is men telling women to stop circumcising their sons. Women don't have penises. So they don't really (and can't really) understand the gravity of the procedure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I tell you to stop, and you don't really know that you're doing anything wrong, you'll tend to ask - why? Why should I stop? And hopefully, that's the start of a conversation. Why does it matter? Because it's awful - and we shouldn't do awful things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody wants to do awful things, and if they're made to be aware just how awful the thing is, they probably won't do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with the Gillette ad, and feminists just going up to men and saying \"Stop raping women\" is that the methodology of the message is really uncharitable and accusatory. If I go to every mother I know and say something like \"You're a terrible person because you circumcised your son and subjected him to the highest pain imaginable,\" she's going to get defensive, and it's not going to work. But we shouldn't circumcise because we shouldn't do awful things. And if we can't tell people to stop doing awful things, then we really can't stop awful things from happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: As /u/EatYourCheckers pointed out, many online communities and parenting subreddits with moms prefer to let their husbands make the decision.

I posted this story in another sub a few days ago so I\u2019m just going to copypasta if you don\u2019t mind:\n\nI went to Kindergarten in a predominately black accelerated learning school. It was a private school though and my mom was a single mom, so she could only afford it for that year. \n\nThe next year, I went to a white public school in the very white area that we lived in at the time.\nBefore the school year started, the school had me tested to see if I was ready to be placed in first grade. I did excellent on the entrance exam, which my mom expected since she knew I was gifted and that I had just left the accelerated program at my old school. I started the first grade that fall, but was super disengaged in class because the curriculum in the class that they placed me in was way behind what I had learned the year before in Kindergarten. I\u2019m fact, I asked my mom at back to school night if I had been held back a grade because the curriculum was that easy. \n\nBecause I was bored and disinterested in class, my teacher came to the conclusion that I was slow and tried to have me placed in the remedial class. Mind you, the school was literally 97% white. The remedial class was about 75% black. This class is apparently where they put all of the black kids they didn\u2019t feel like teaching. My mom was having none of that shit though. She marched right up to that school and explained to them the type of mistake they were making. Eventually, about two months into first grade, they actually advanced me to the second grade. After that I did great in school and everything was fine. \n\nSo yeah, the reason why we have all black schools is because we don\u2019t get properly educated otherwise. White teachers don\u2019t care about black children, and in some cases have an active disdain for them. Starting in preschool, [ black children are suspended at far higher rates than white children. ](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/21/292456211/black-preschoolers-far-more-likely-to-be-suspended)\n\nAlso, you\u2019re ignoring the fact that white people don\u2019t even want black children in their schools. [De facto segregation is still alive and well in our schools here in the US. ](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/school-segregation-is-not-a-myth/555614/) Why would we send our children to school with people who don\u2019t even want them there?",

Government guarantees on student loans mean that university can hike its tuition rates as high as they want, because the government will pay for it and student loan debt can\u2019t ever be erased.  Before government got involved, universities had to make college affordable for students.  They had to actually compete.  Get the government disinvolved, and prices will go down after a couple of years because no one will be able to afford those exhorbitant tuition rates.  \n\nHealthcare is much the same way.  Government started footing the bill, so of course hospitals and pharma companies raised their prices.  It happens every single time that the government subsidizes cost without instituting a price control.  \n\nSo there are two \u201cfixes\u201d for this problem:  go back to a free market system, or institute price controls by unconstitutionally seizing hospitals and pharma companies to manage them with the government.  Otherwise, prices will just continue to balloon until the system fails.\n\nSo, the problem isn\u2019t with capitalism, because we really aren\u2019t practicing capitalism when it comes to those two industries.  The government subsidizes them, which constitutes socialism.

So trying to give very fat people motivation to stop losing weight, is like throwing a glass of water into the Atlantic. Nothing you do can possibly be as big as what's already there.\n\n(Here's something I'll ask you to think about: if some of the \"fat pride\" rhetoric seems over-the-top, it's like someone leaning forward to struggle forward against an overpowering wind. For some fat people, they NEED to be over-the-top with their self-affirmations, just to resist the constant, powerful societal messages saying that we are worthless and we should despise ourselves.)\n\nNearly every obese person you see has tried to lose weight, many of them multiple times. Many have lost weight and regained it, because that's what happens to the overwhelming majority of dieters, long term - they lose weight for a while, but 5 years later it's all come back (and many weigh more).\n\nSecondly, there is [simply no weight loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17469900) (or \"lifestyle change\") program that has ever been proven effective in a peer-reviewed study. The only \"successful\" weight loss studies are the ones that stop following subjects after the first year or two; all long-term studies have shown that the weight comes back.\n\n[The odds are steeply against](http://amptoons.com/blog/?p=20934) someone like me ever losing enough weight to stop being obese, and the odds are even steeper against *keeping* the weight off. \n\nGiven those odds, aren't I better off concentrating on ways to improve my life other than losing weight? For instance, exercise and improving my diet to emphasize fresh veggies probably won't make me lose weight, but they have a 100% change of making me feel better and healthier.

Here, I show that herbicide use intensity increased over the last 25 years in maize, cotton, rice and wheat. Although GE crops have been previously implicated in increasing herbicide use, herbicide increases were more rapid in non-GE crops.\u00a0\n\nBut then they do this:\n\n&gt;The minority of growers not using GE technology today are probably not representative of all growers, and therefore their pesticide use is almost certainly not an accurate way to compare overall pesticide use between GE and conventional crops. For example, farmers might not adopt glyphosate-resistant crops because weed densities on their farm are relatively low, or if the farmer is not managing herbicide-resistant weeds. Herbicide use is likely to be lower for these non-adopters regardless of which technology they use for weed control. Results of these comparisons would likely bias results toward higher herbicide use in GE crops.\n\nSo he then just dismisses them as non relevant. Seems sketchy. Seems like comfirmation bias.\n\n&gt;Whether or not tillage is used explicitly for weed control, most tillage operations will provide weed control benefits like killing emerged seedlings and burying weed seed. When tillage is reduced, farmers become more reliant on other weed control practices, including herbicides. At least some of the widespread increase in herbicide use is certainly attributable to adoption of conservation tillage practices. It is important, then, to weigh the concern of increased herbicide use with the benefits that may have also accrued.\n\nAsk yourself this question: why would this be? Maybe it's cheaper to douse the field in herbicides than to put hours upon hours of work into it. The crops can take it, so screw it, spray away. \n\nThis study is very harsh on other studies, but lacks in many fields. To put it bluntly: It's a study on how toxic herbicides are to rats. Not the environment in which it was used. Not on surrounding plantlife, insects and everything that it touches. \n\n&gt;To put it bluntly, it is simple to determine whether a rat is dead or alive.\n \n-------\n\n&gt;You are. \n\nJeezus, I try to be chivalrous for once, no need to be a dick about it.\n\n-------\n\n&gt;And the Supreme Court unanimously said no.\n\nLaws and morals are not the same. It's not because it's the law it's therefor just.\n\nYou first said: does 't matter because nobody does it.

This means that if abortion is murder, two things must be true. 1) The embryo must be considered a human. 2) Abortions must be *illegal*. \n\nBecause abortions are legal, they definitionally aren't murder. Even if you consider an embryo a human. This is the same reason euthanasia isn't murder, because it's legally endorsed. This is the same reason injecting a prisoner on death row with a toxin isn't murder, because it's legal. \n\nSo categorically, you're wrong to call abortion murder. But we can also contest whether an embryo is a human. \n\nIn 2015, according to the CDC, about 71% of abortions occurred within 9 weeks of gestation (which means an embryonic age of 7 weeks). During the 8th week of gestation, the [neural tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube) closes (which is the precursor to the mammal's CNS). That means all these aborted embryos don't even have brains, let alone a cerebral cortex to experience feelings, let alone the concept of life. \n\nAbout 91% of abortions occur before the end of the first trimester (after which stage, the embryo is called a fetus). By now, the fetus still doesn't have a brain, and the distinction between the first and second trimester is one where the embryo essentially becomes a fetus (this is drawn because it's when the fetus begins more rapid neurological development). This means 91% of all abortions done are on embryos. \n\nThe majority of the rest of the abortions done (after first trimester) are ones you already advocate for (high danger to mother's life).\n\nhttps://www.abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/",

They are closed on weekends, and even on weekdays, they are only open from about 9am-5pm. You have to pay to mail anything, and yet the post office still operates on a deficit, and they have to use tax money to stay afloat. And for a long time, they were the only place you could go to mail things. And it was expensive (even tho they operated at a loss). And even with planes and cars it took a week to mail a letter to the next county.\n\nFedex, UPS, DHL, etc. offer the exact same services as the post office. They are open til 9pm, and open on weekends. They make weekend deliveries. They make overnight deliveries, and 2-day deliveries for cheaper than the post office could do in 2 weeks. The post office does this NOW, but they didn't have that service until well after private carriers invented it. After Fedex came along, the post office has had to drastically reduce prices in order to compete, which means it costs even more tax dollars to keep the post office running, because they operate at an even bigger loss than before. The only reason the post office even stays open anymore is because they are required to by law. But we are literally just wasting money, because we have at least 4 or 5 other companies that can do the exact same thing for cheaper. And guess what? Not only does Fedex, etc. make a profit, they PAY taxes, rather than take them. So it would be much better for everyone if we took all the business the post office does, give it to Fedex, who will pay taxes on each delivery, rather than use tax money on each delivery.\n\nSo why again should I want drugs developed by the government?",

The lack of physical contact generally would preclude this from being sexual assault and would carry a lesser charge. \n\nAs to should this sub be banned? I'm not sure I necessarily agree with that either unless we're going to start banning a lot more of the porn-type subs on reddit. There are plenty of subs where people, primarily women, are exposing themselves in public. \n\nIs there a double standard there? Absolutely. But the same double standard can be seen in the laws we have regarding indecent exposure. If a guy came to the door in boxers and no shirt on, that wouldn't be a crime, in and of itself. At the same time, a woman, topless in underwear would be indecent exposure. If that's the legal standard we set for men, but not for women, then there's already a disparity we're trying to cope with.\n\nIf the claim is that reddit should ban subs depicting all illegal behavior, then we've expanded the reach well beyond what it currently is. If we ban subs glorifying illegal behavior, then we still have to ban a lot of huge subs to apply a universal rule like that. \n\nAs to your point about the victim being trapped, it certainly depends on their workplace.

            "text": "&gt; The issue centered around criminalizing marijuana in the first place contains racist origins, as one of the main topics of discussion centered around the legalization of marijuana pertains to the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans and other minority ethnic groups. About a century ago, hemp fibers were integrated into everyday life such as clothes, ropes and paper. Business Insider said that a propaganda film portrayed marijuana in a negative light, whereas the media portrayed it as a gateway drug around the 1930\u2019s. Later, it was connected as a violence stimulant for African American and Hispanic people, which aided it in being criminalized. This led to African American &amp; Hispanic individuals to be arrested more than whites, a statistic that is still prevalent in today\u2019s time.\n\nNone of this actually supports your central argument. It's basically a strawman, considering almost none of these things are central to the reasons marijuana is criminalized in many places today. I have not seen any proof that minorities are unfairly discriminated against in regards to marijuana possession - just because they are arrested at a higher rate for it does not prove discrimination.\n\n&gt; Legalizing marijuana and taxing it like alcohol can have a major benefit on the US economy. States such as Colorado have over 3,000 businesses in their state and has generated over $6.5 billion. According to the Colorado Sun, their marijuana tax cash fund that Colorado receives must be used for health care, health education, substance abuse prevention programs and law enforcement.\n\nThis is completely unrelated to the argument, so you don't have to answer this, but I would like to ask you a rhetorical question: What are your thoughts on Trump's proposal that we all go back to work amid COVID-19 for the sake of saving the economy?\n\n&gt; If we are to adopt the federal legalization of marijuana, we can have the opportunity to combat both racial discrimination and incarceration of minority individuals and increase federal revenue that we can use for national programs to benefit education, homelessness, and free programs for communities.\n\nI am not convinced that there is any true discrimination at play. I will agree with you that it could increase government revenue, however, this point alone is not nearly strong enough to be an argument for legalization, because there are literally hundreds of different things the government could do to increase its revenue, many of which I believe would be preferable to marijuana legalization.\n\nI believe the best way to illustrate why cannabis is not a universally positive thing is by telling you about my own experience.\n\nI used to be a very heavy cannabis user. I would roll my own joints and buy weed by the quarter pound. I would smoke pretty much every day, and on occasion multiple times per day, almost always with my friends.\n\nToday, I have not smoked cannabis in four months, after having gradually dialed back the rate at which I was smoking. I've seen enormous benefits in my life since, such as higher grades, a better social life, and a more fulfilling romantic relationship. Why is this?\n\nUltimately, while marijuana can be enjoyable for a user for the short time after they smoke, it has zero proven benefits in the long run and has many detriments. It is a fact that it is terrible for your memory - anyone who has ever gotten reasonably high can attest to this. There would be times where I would have incredibly long conversations with a friend, and would forget the words that I had said five seconds prior, which would result in the conversation ending because we both had no idea what we were talking about. The next day, I would forget most of what I experienced during the time I was high, and would be a bit sluggish for the first few hours of the day, which usually resulted in the entire rest of the day being wasted on idle tasks. I am not sure whether cannabis has notable harmful effects on your long term memory, although I suspect that it does. If you consume it every day, it certainly will, because those small fragments of your memory that are lost will add up with time.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether cannabis is a harmful drug comes down to your worldview. What do you think the point of life is? Would you rather live as a docile, sedated being, without true awareness of your surroundings or any power to change them, or live as a lucid man, with the ability to experience difficulty and have it shape you into a better person? If you choose the former, that is fine, but you should be aware of what you are picking.\n\nIf you have ever read the novel *Brave New World* (if you haven't - go read it now), I find myself sympathizing with John.

            "text": "It's definitely is a complicated situation, mixed in with the complicated politics of the #MeToo movement and the importance of the 2020 election. However, I want to make a few points:\n\n1. As others have pointed out, Reade's allegations have serious credibility issues. First, the nature of her allegations about Biden has changed over time -- last year, she said that his tendency towards touching would make her feel uncomfortable, but that she never felt sexualized; now she's accusing him of violent sexual assault. Second, she claims to have filed an official Senate complaint against him after the alleged assault, but no one has been able to find record of such a complaint. Third, none of Biden's former Senate staffers from the time period corroborate her account of his general behavior or of having heard any rumors/complaints about any such assault. ~~And while she claims to have corroboration from friends and family, it's unclear which allegation they're corroborating: the uncomfortable, but not sexual, atmosphere/touching or the outright sexual assault~~. Fourth, as recent as 2017, Reade was actively praising Biden for his contributions to protecting women's rights, including sexual assault victims, as well as his support for the #MeToo movement. Fifth, she went through a recent period of an almost obsessive praise of Vladimir Putin (including claiming that the reason she left DC was because she was sick of the U.S. government's anti-Russia sentiment). Sixth, if something this significant were out there, you would think that it would have been discovered during Biden's vetting by the Obama campaign in 2008 (and subsequently resulted in him not being tapped as VP). Seventh, while she made headlines *last week* by formally filing a criminal complaint with D.C. Metro Police re: the assault, in the complaint, she specifically does not name her alleged assailant. However, she has repeatedly stated on social media and in further interviews that the complaint is about Biden. Why is this a problem? Because if she's willing to very publicly name Biden as her assailant, why would she not name him in the criminal complaint? Raises strong suspicions that she's covering her bases to avoid possible \"filing a false police report\" charges. Finally, the intentional timing of her disclosing her allegation -- on Super Tuesday, with at least a week of teasing build-up -- adds further suspicion to her motives/credibilty. **TL;DR**: **there are several reasons to question the credibility of this allegation.**\n2. The \"Left\" has been discussing the allegation -- it's just not receiving front page, all-consuming coverage like the Kavanaugh allegation. And while there is probably a degree of partisan bias behind that difference, there's also contextual differences as well. Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh were determined to be fairly credible (certainly enough to warrant deeper investigations). The nature of Kavanaugh's nomination placed greater weight on examining it publicly -- he was up for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the GOP was working to rush through his confirmation. The Kavanaugh hearings also happened during the peak of the #MeToo movement and during a period where it was the dominant political news story. Right now, #MeToo has largely fallen from the public spotlight, and the nation's focus is trained on the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic recession. Even with all that, publications are discussing this assault -- from various Medium articles, to the initial SoundCloud interview where Reade released the allegation, to the recent NYT investigatory piece on it. It's not being ignored.\n3. The other allegations against Biden largely focus on his touching -- none of them accuse him of predatory behavior, but rather inappropriate/uncomfortable touching/holding. This has largely been digested by the public already (hell, it's been a long meme/joke about Biden dating back to the Obama years). The general consensus seems to be that Biden is simply from a different generation, where people would touch/hold each other more often as a point of human contact/connection, but that sentiment about these kind of things have changed. Biden even acknowledged as such and promised to be more cognizant of his actions (and we haven't seen any novel complaints about him since).\n4. In examining how this will play into the race against Donald Trump, it's hard to really say, but I'm inclined to think (for now) that it won't be a decisive factor either way. Trump has many more credible sexual assault accusations against himself. And in consistent polling, Biden wins a resounding majority of female voters against Trump, in no small part because they support Biden's politics/agenda over Trump's.\n\nShould we dismiss these allegations, particularly Reade's, simply out of hand? No, of course not. The whole idea behind \"believe the victim\" is that you take allegations seriously and investigate further. However, if the allegations are determined not to be credible, you don't push further, especially when additional avenues (such as criminal investigations/court proceedings) are unavailable (here, due to the statute of limitations). Personally, it seems the people trying to elevate this to a dominant news story/issue are: (1) Trump trolls, and (2) disaffected Bernie supporters who are looking for any excuse not to support/vote for Biden in the general election.\n\n**EDIT:** I want to respond to a repeated point raised in some of these responses (and it's easier to do via an Edit than responding to each individual comment). Re: the comparison to the allegations against Kavanaugh:\n\nNo, I am not saying that the presidency is less significant/important than a seat on the Supreme Court, nor am I saying allegations against a presidential candidate/nominee don't matter. My point was:\n\n1. The Kavanaugh situation was on a rushed timeline -- Kavanaugh was nominated in July 2018 and the Senate Republicans wanted to quickly push through his confirmation in case the Senate somehow flipped party-control following the 2018 midterms (something that was a possibility by that point in the year)\n2. Additionally, given the lifetime nature of a Supreme Court seat, there was added urgency to address this allegation before he was confirmed (as no Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached, let alone successfully removed from the bench, in U.S. history) -- together with #1, this created a stronger sense of urgency and magnitude to the allegation\n3. Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh were, IMO, far more credible compared to Reade's allegations against Biden\n\n**EDIT 2:** Striking portion re: Reade's alleged corroborations not being specifically about the alleged assault, as /u/debasing_the_coinage corrected.\n\n**EDIT 3:** Adding in another red flag re: Reade's credibility -- in the Metro PD criminal complaint that she just filed last week re: the assault, Reade specifically does not name Biden as her assailant, however, she has stated on social media that the complaint is about him. If she was willing to publicly name Biden as her assailant, why would she not name him in the complaint? (hint: lying on an official police report/complaint is a criminal offense)",

A family friend trained dogs for the police and those animals wouldn't dare to attack you unless commanded! Of course we can't expect a family dog to be as well trained but still - a trained animal will have to be genuinely attacked first.\n\nSomeone shouting at an animal, or angering it by doing something stupid is...well stupid, but being injured or worse is not a fit punishment. The animal should be trained to not respond to generic 'tomfoolery'. Kids shouting, doing something dumb, etc... \n\nI think it's very hard to just say \"we shouldn't feel bad for them\" without seeing the underlaying causes. A lot of cases of people being harmed by animals falls to the owner. There were instances of dogs murdering a person. They may have been dicks, but they don't deserve to die.\n\nIf they kick the animal that's a different matter entirely, that's just instinct at that point. Doing something lesser though - I don't see it, I think we should be compassionate. Animals, especially in cities, must be trained and trained WELL! \n\nA more of a personal example:\n\nWe always had a family dog - a German Shepard. Gorgeous and sweet dogs. We got them from the police friend. Issue was with our latest one we got an aggressive one, one that was so hard to train even my dad who used to work server in the army, or my uncle who was a criminal investigator were unable to handle him. \n\nStill the dog would listen but it was difficult to have him. One day a neighborhood kid annoyed him over the fence a bit. The dog got out and attacked him. Thankfully the boy wasn't harmed (he managed to climb a tree). \n\nThere was only one party at fault - the dog. We should have trained him better, but I was a kid and my parents were going through a rough patch at work. Yet at the same time you can say that the kid shouldn't have provoked him. \n\nReality is some animals are aggressive and will attack. He almost bit my father. The next day we put him down as a courtesy to everyone in the neighborhood. We haven't had a large dog since. \n\nWhat I am trying to say by this is that animals differ same as do owners. I would never blame the kid, even if it may seem it was largely his fault. An animal kept at a home should **never** attack someone who is pretty much just 'teasing' over a fence. Not once, not ever. Animals must be trained (unless their purpose is to keep trespassers from a property etc..)",

Usain Bolt has a biological advantage that made him the fastest man in history, by your logic it's unfair for him to race against any other man because of that advantage.\n\nWhat we actually want is people of relatively similar ability competing against each other to keep things interesting, women don't race men because there's no point competing in a race they can't win. Transgender athletes raise an interesting question as it makes the classification difficult but just because it's difficult it didn't mean we shouldn't do it. \n\nThe question should be 'does the inclusion of trans women in women's sport make women's sport uncompetitive?' I think the answer to that is pretty clearly no. There are few trans women computing at an elite level, even fewer are winning and even fewer are dominating.\n\nThe only problems that do arise come only when a trans women wins something, it's never when they're just competing, that in itself tells us something about the nature of the complaints.",

In dialects of English (including standard British English) that have non-rhotic speech, \"n@@#er\u201d and \"nigga\" are often[a] pronounced the same. \n\nMany people consider the terms to be equally pejorative, and the use of \"nigga\" both in and outside black communities remains controversial. H. Lewis Smith, author of Bury That Sucka: A Scandalous Love Affair with the N-word, believes that \"replacing the 'er' with an 'a' changes nothing other than the pronunciation\"\n\nSome African-Americans only consider \"nigga\" offensive when used by people of other races, seeing its use outside a defined social group as an unwelcome cultural appropriation. Used by blacks, the term may indicate \"solidarity or affection\",similar to the usage of the words \"dude\", \"homeboy\", and \"bro\". Others consider \"nigga\" non-offensive except when directed from a non-African-American towards an African-American.

And the president ran on a platform of heavily taxing farmers, because after all, farmers can pull in over $1-2m per year! That would play very well in cities with high populations, and workers that typically don't see that much money ever.\n\n...but a lot of people who live in cities have never even seen a farm, and thus don't know that while a big farmer may earn 1-2million in a big crop year, about 950k of that 1m goes straightttt back into the farm. So while you're handling a few mil, you're maybe keeping 50k or so. Less in a bad year. Combine harvester break? That'll be half a million. Plus several hundred thousand on seed, etc. But if you were able to sell coastal voters making about 60-80k that farmers need \"fewer tax loopholes\" and painted them as big-time millionaires, that would probablyyy play well there.\n\nIn that scenario, farmers would essentially have no say whatsoever in the presidential process, because if every farmer voted as a block they would not be able to make a dent in LA, NYC, etc voting against them. Yet, farmers produce an enormous amount of the raw material needed for food, drinks, and many other things. It would essentially be a taxation without representation situation, because how on earth are their voices going to be heard *if they're drowned out by a larger population with little to no knowledge* about how those policies they're supporting hurt a minority of american workers?\n\nNow that's just a massively simplified example that ignores the role of Congress, tax writeoffs, and I 100% agree that this sort of happens in different forms now (Biden talking about fracking to win PA votes, for example), but there's no system that perfectly works. Majority rulings have just as many potential issues and problems as the electoral college (the farmer example) and the electoral college can mean some people's voices are overvalued (denser population areas having less electoral votes per capita). The electoral college isn't a perfect system, but it does try and be a compromise between strict majority rule which can be dangerous; just because the majority of people make a choice doesn't mean that choice isn't the right one and the minority doesn't deserve protection.",

Trump is going to be in a lot of legal trouble after he leaves office from entities like the New York AG. If Trump stays in the US he will likely be arrested and put on trial, so 2024 run doesn't seem likely. \n\nSo the most probable answer is Trumps final acts as Commander in Chief are a way of  continuing to secure favor with Russia in a bid for an escape plan once he leaves office.

Thus, everyone is required to contribute via taxes to keep these services running. You can't take from the pot without adding to it, so people who make money in our society (and de facto benefit from these services) for their own personal benefit are required to pay a portion of their income to cover this cost. This also applies to for-profit businesses that are operated to produce profit (income beyond running costs) for private interests.\n\nNon-profits however, are organisations that are operated to provide a service to the public instead of generating personal wealth. The key factor here is a non-profit, as the name suggests, shouldn't be producing profit. Income should all be going back into the organisation and the services it provides. As soon as that money leaves the organisation (i.e. as salaries) it is subject to tax.\n\nSo, knwing this, we can see why the Catholic Church is fundamentally different from Amazon. Church revenue (in theory) goes back into the community and services they provide rather than into the Pope's piggy bank (apart from their salary which is ofc subject to tax, so is irrelevant to your argument).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, are there organisations that maybe circumvent these rules, such as megachurches where pastors buy private jets? Well, possibly, but either way that point actually doesn't support your view in the way you seem to think it does. \n\nSay a pastor purchases a private jet - either they are using an exorbitant income paid out from the church donations (which is unequivocably wrong, unless we're talking a meagre salary that has just been saved for decades - virtually unheard of, but still) or they are somehow able to claim that is a cost related to the services the church provides to it's parishioners. \n\nIn the former instance, your point is rendered moot as that income would be subject to taxation. It's still morally dubious but in regards to taxation, if all personal income taxes are properly paid then there is no issue as far as the state is concerned. \n\nNow to the latter; this would be a failing of regulation, either the regulations themselves are too lax or the tax collection institutions are not doing their job properly. Neither of these are actually an argument that churches should not be tax-exempt, they are reasons that the laws should be refined and processes improved. The good reasons for religious organisations (and other non-profits) being allowed to operate as tax-exempt still exist and are entirely valid regardless of the minority who decide to game the system.",

If I have made any errors I'll happily change my original assessment where appropriate.\n\n\nThough I will say, regarding the LDS slush fund, an example of \"church does shady thing\" with tax exemption is already covered by what I originally said. It has no bearing on whether churches should be tax exempt, all it says is the regulation needs improvement as certain organisations exploit the rules.\n\n\nI would like to kindly remind you that OPs position is one in which religious organisations are not tax-exempt at all, not just, \"certain organisation that exploit tax exemption should be better controlled\" (which I actually entirely agree with btw).

Or maybe just can't?\n\nEdit: Read the cases, they literally don't have anyhthing to do with what I said. Lemon v. Kurtzman deemed an act that allowed a public school superintendent to reimburse salaries of private religious school teachers as unconstitutional on grounds of entangling, and Locke v. Davey ruled that it wasn't unconstitutional for the state of Washington to withdraw scholarship funding when a student wanted to enroll on a theology course.\n\nThose cases are 100% irrelevant to churches being tax exempt in general (all I can think is that they are maybe tangentially related to one of my examples?) since they address issues of state funding being entangled with religous institutions, which is not something I or the OP discussed. \n\nAdding the edit to confirm that after chasing after the bad faith reading list of someone who haughtily refused to substantiate their point, there was indeed nothing of relevance to my points or even the core of my argument.

On three occasions I can recall growing up a dog followed a neighborhood kid into their backyard, one being just a puppy and were mauled to death. And another time one of them jumped the fence into my yard and killed our cat. One of the dogs, the one that killed my cat, was nice to humans, but the other would bark and snap at the fence the whole time we played in my yard and no matter how long I lived there or tried to make friends with it, it always acted like it wanted to attack. It always had to be brought in whenever kids would go over their house.\n\nWhen we moved we got a blue healer which was attacked by a pitbull that roamed the neighborhood as there were no leash laws in the country. We were able to get it to run away, not by brute force which we tried, but by spraying it with a water hose. My mom wound up getting bite by the same pit checking the mail.\n\nMy aunt and grandmother were also both bitten by a pit while visiting my uncle a few years ago and both had to go to the hospital for injuries to their legs and forearm. I also remember a three legged pit stray that seemed nice and we all dubbed Tripod, chased down a little boy on a bike and bite his leg.\n\nThere are more things I could list but I\u2019m sure you probably already don\u2019t believe me that all of this is true, but it is. Does that mean they should go extinct? No way. But they are dangerous and aggressive and in my view need owners that know how to deal with those attributes, people should have to attend a class to own them. Trying to convince people they aren\u2019t dangerous or don\u2019t need any special type or training and upbringing is also dangerous.",

When I did things in high school too dramatically, it wasn\u2019t about some grand plan to nationally humiliate the girl who cheated on me, it was about not having learned to deliberate, control my emotions, or have much self-awareness. How could I possibly be expected in good faith to scrutinize this kid\u2019s actions as if he\u2019s the University of Tennessee himself, rather than a disgruntled black kid who was pissed that the school blew him off when he showed them her snap. \n\nThere\u2019s this really bizarre double standard to the situation that I find incredibly problematic, least of all because he was the one who, according to the facts as you\u2019ve presented them, grew up attending a school with a pretty hostile racial environment. Why would an 18 year old kid know how to navigate that perfectly? \n\nI know I heard tons and tons of slurs at my nearly all white high school growing up. Thankfully I was just a selfish white teenager whose responsibilities included learning trigonometry and going to basketball practice.

Again, I\u2019m merely relying on the story\u2019s events as you\u2019ve described them.\n\nWhether you think he overreacted or not, do you think you should have a little fairness and consistency between how you judge him and the white girl? Is the legal difference between an 18 year old and a 14 year old really enough to give her a 100% pass and tell a sob victim story on her behalf, whereas Galligan\u2019s actions are \u201csickening?\u201d\n\nAlso, why are you even talking about the boy\u2019s behavior?

The story reflects the worst tendencies of the modern social justice movement to see revenge as a suitable replacement for justice and to deny people the chance to grow and change and improve themselves as we all must do if we want to make the world better.\n\nOn the other hand I think it's somewhat telling about our ingrained attitudes how we so often demand that people suffering and struggling and dealing with a lot under prejudiced systems must only respond to the hardships they face in a hypothetically perfect manner. \n\nIf we're angry at what the girl has had to go through we should be even more outraged by the racism the boy has had to face his whole life.

Then he loses viewers/sponsorship deals. Then he apologizes. Then he waits a bit. Then he starts the cycle over. You can set your clock by it. I didn't know there was a new controversy, but it makes sense. \n\nHe has done more to push kids towards the Alt-Right and neo-Nazis than almost anyone. Most adults can see through what he does (whether they support it or are against it), but most kids haven't developed those critical thinking skills yet. He pulls them in with funny jokes and then slips in casual racism until they get used to it. It's a process of normalizing racism.

The basic idea is that humans as we know them - we of course being those in the West because Europeans 'invented' science - are white.\n\nIt was largely used in a scientific context initially, to describe (debunked) theories about speciation among humans. From the get go, it was a largely academic term that in the 19th and 20th century entered parlance as a negative term.\n\nRacism of course has evolved, and I think most academics now would acknowledge that - for instance - you could be Han Chinese living in China and be racist against Uighurs by believing them to be sub-human. So it's not about white people specifically.\n\nIf a black person is being bigoted against someone for being white in America, do you think they feel the white person is sub-human because of their whiteness? Or are they just making judgements based on assumptions of the culture the white person grew up in? I'd say there's an important different in these two cases.",

Perhaps I am among the fragile white, but make no mistake there is strong backlash to the newer definitions of racism. \n\nWhite people that strive to not treat individuals or groups differently because of their race and believe they are successful don\u2019t understand a lot of the recent finger pointing, many have decided the best thing to do is ignore it. Others have decide to actively say bullshit. This I can say with certainty, the push back is growing.\n\nPeople used to be called racist for actual attitudes and actions. Also accepting of or actual proactive exclusion of people from jobs and parts of society based on race. \n\nNow we hear we are racist for who we vote for, our stance on immigration, our thoughts about national healthcare, any opinions about any issue on society in general that does not align with the majority of POC and progressives.\n\nCalling a person racist is much more than a word defining their actions. Calling a person racist is meant to be, and is a demeaning insult to character, intelligence and morality. So when you say if you are one of 74 million voting for Trump then you are a racist, you have hurled a horrible insult at tens of millions good people that are not racist. They can accept that attack on the core of who they are, or they can say bullshit, and decide to push back hard, because that is what most do when you constantly demean them. \n\nI will be called racist for pointing out there is a backlash, but look hard and you will find nothing but my opinion on the doubling down on accusations of racism. \n\nIf as you read this you feel I am racist what you are having is a natural strong emotion about someone you strongly disagree with on the subject of racial politics. Your emotions, not my actions or words makes you want to call me a racist, so some will.\n\nEveryone should call out real discrimination for racial reasons. In our institutions, our work places, in personal interactions and when it hits the airway. \n\n**To your point on racism vs systematic racism**\n\nAn Ethnic Studies professor wrote a paper stating that many black kids were falling behind in math classes that they share with white kids due to white supremacy. They focused on the the way it is taught. This paper will have a net negative effect. \n\nChoosing the words White Supremacy they labeled thousands of caring teachers white supremacist. Many of those people feel attacked. Being a white supremacist is horrific.\n\nThey may be  choosing to teach in middle-school math schools that are 90% black, not because it\u2019s easy or the only job they can get, but because they are trying to be where they are most needed. But it really doesn\u2019t matter where they are teaching black kids, they have been demeaned.\n\nSome will heed the words, but I imagine many more will say bullshit, feel their character was attacked, grow a bit more bitter and question the veracity any time someone points out white supremacy in action.",

No one would treat a cisgender heterosexual in a prejudice manner because they are not sexually attracted to trans people. Quite the contrary in fact.\n\nGenerally it is agreed that all heterosexuals do not have to be attracted to trans people, or that is transphobic not to be. For example, some bi or gay people do not find trans people sexually attractive. The point is though that they don't make a big thing our of it. They don't go around telling people that they are not attracted to trans people because it is hurtful to the trans community to be told that they are not lovable. \n\nSo to clarify:\n\nNo one is saying you *have* to find trans people attractive, there just saying that the fact that you don't is not cause to coin a whole new sexuality.\n\nPeople often think superstraights are acting transphobicly because they are telling an oppressed group (who themselves are deeply scared that no one can love them as themselves) that they are categorically unattractive. \n\nSo even if you are not attracted to trans people, it disrespectful to the trans community to not only broadcast this so vocally, but also be *proud* of it and claim that because you find them so sexually unattractive that you deserve to join their wider community: the lgbtq+ community. \n\nSo because superstraights are literally saying that they should be part of a safe group trans people are part of *because of their lack of attraction to trans people*. I'm sure you can understand why this would cause many trans people to feel threatened and unsafe in the lgbtq+ community. \n\nPeople can be sexually attracted to whoever they like, but superstraights are using their sexuality in a way that can come off as malicious. Because of this most people believe it is better that they just continue to identify as heterosexual, and not attempt to join the lgbtq+ because they are vocally opposed to dating trans people.",

The Chinese government has extremely high approval rates with ratings in the 90s. \n\nB. The Chinese government is extremely stable. Of course Mao's China is different from Deng's China and I would say that it is Deng who created modern China and Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and this has been expanded by Presidents Jiang, Hu, and now Xi. \n\nC. China has extremely good prospects in the future, China's economy is set to surpass the US economy in 2050, with no signs of stopping. \n\nD. The Chinese quality of life has risen dramatically over the years after the revolution. The average Chinese lifespan has risen from 44.6 in 1950 to to 75.3 years in 2015. The Chinese middle class is growing extremely fast and it is very easy to see. Large brands like Disney, and the NBA are all trying to capture this market. \n\nE. China is extremely good at making deals that benefit both sides. With the Belt and Road initiative and funding projects in Africa, China brings wealth to itself and others. Furthermore, China does not act like global police, drone striking political opponents. \n\nF. China has been at the forefront of the battle against climate change even when other countries has faltered. As of now, China is the world's biggest manufacturer of solar panels and also has the world's largest hydroelectric dam. \n\nBills in China are passed extremely quickly. Hospitals are built in time spans measured in hours, not days, weeks, or months. Entire cities can be shut down, trains stopped, people welded into their houses. No debate is needed when the authorities decide what will happen. \n\nThere is no partisan infighting in China because at the end of the day, everybody wants China to succeed and the President has the ultimate say. \n\nMisinformation and yellow journalism is all but nonexistent in China, the government makes sure that every news source, radio, tv, internet, print, aligns with what the government deems as correct. \n\nI end my case by asking the reader to consider that China is a nation of 1.398 billions souls. A nation with more than 4 times the amount of people as the US. The problems of governance are multiplied the more people there are. The fact that China is able to be where it is today is a testament to it's type of government.",

It clearly doesn't follow from the single piece of evidence you've presented.\n\nSince that's your only evidence, you're saying this:\n\n\"If you are a Foreign Native in America who pretends to not know English you are hurting how others see your race because someone may notice your lie and, from that lie, assume that every foreign-born person in America claims not to speak English is lying.\"\n\nNo one is following that logic unless they are also openly racist/xenophobic, so it's not a real concern.\n\nIf this happened to me (or most people), I would go, \"Oh shit. That guy was sort of a dick to me.\"\n\nI would not use that single example as my benchmark for how an entire class of people behaves. I would not do this because I'm not openly racist.",

The thing I was most aware of in transportation was how I was affecting other people.  For example, on the train, I would stand rather than taking a middle seat because it wouldn't be fair to the people I plopped down next to because they didn't make the choice to sit next to me.\n\nThe reason I am saying this is, while I was at my biggest weight, I took an airplane flight and took advantage of the fact that my weight qualified me to have an empty seat next to me, and I took it.  This meant that there wasn't a person I was pushing against against their will.  But if I had to pay for the extra seat, I wouldn't have done it, because it would have been too much money, and in doing so, I would have caused another passenger to have a worse flight because of it.  Don't think of it as \"why does that person get extra space\" but think of it more as a \"nobody being forced to be squished next to that person who is spilling over their seat.\"  Both the person who is overweight, and the people on the other side of an empty seats benefit.\n\nP.S.

If we start making this the standard then the net result is less available seats for everyone, which will then drive the price up for everyone.\n\nIn your case, I would say the two seats would be better utilized by seating two standard sized passengers at full price, rather than a single larger person.",

But most properties are managed by a maintenance team that makes like $12/hr and don't own the property at all. \n\nI think people should be rewarded for their labor, not for owning things. So I would love to see the people who do the labor of maintaining a property be well paid, whether they are maintenance guys for a large company or small time landlords. The problem is that as long as property is an investment, most of the money generated will go to the person/corporation whose name is on the deed, whether that person does any of the work or not. \n\n&gt;Not every landlord is rich and I imagine a lot of them have bills and loans to pay.\n\nThis would also be solved by paying property managers for their *labor* instead of their *wealth.* A small time landlord would be better off just being paid better for their time. But because we've unnecessarily complicated things by declaring \"ownership\" entitles people/corporations to loads of money, that doesn't happen. You can't get paid a decent wage to manage a dozen apartments because some other corporation will just undercut you and charge less rent, and hire a maintenance guy and pay him $12. If you're a small time landlord you will make less than $12/hr all for the right for society to agree that your name on the deed entitles you to a lot of money in 30 years. It would be so much simpler if we did away with the deeds and just paid people for their labor.",

He may be an asshole or not I'm not here to argue that.  But regardless some facts aren't in dispute. The night before Car Source burned, garbage cans and trailers were set on fire.  Other businesses were vandalized.  The police did nothing. So business owners like the owners of Car Source have people, including Rittenhouse, protect their other locations. If the government shut these protests down immediately after vandalism, it would be unnecessary.  I don't think they should have a 17 year old protecting their business with a gun.  But responsible adults? It makes sense to me.\n\nIn Seattle protestors pushed the police out of a precinct and set up the.Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ).  The city kept it up for 3 weeks.  There were 5 shootings and it was up for 10 days after that.  The city did nothing.  Owners of businesses couldn't open and some were vandalized.. These city officials bend over backwards for these violent rioters, anarchists and vandals. There care more about videos ending up on YouTube or TikTok with no context than helping law abiding citizens.  So when some  cities  care so little for their residents and their property, many people feel arming themselves is their only option.\n\nDoes that mean everyone holding a gun isn't an asshole?!

It is only a black eye they didnt really mean it they were just angry in the moment because of work stuff. I love them and they love me so this violence is okay, I am fine, they would not REALLY hurt me. \n\nAlso, gay couples. A man is getting abused. Should spousal abuse/domestic abuse laws not protect them because they are also a man like the person that beat them?\n\nThere is a good amount to take umbrage with in what you said and implied. I disagree with your methodology and reasoning. \n\nIntimate relationships are given special consideration because of the intimacy of the relationship and the vulnerability of it. \n\nIf you beat the crap out of some stranger that is assault.

They're more likely to live in safer neighborhoods, more likely to attend better schools, more likely to live lives untouched by childhood trauma. And that's because white people were the only people who could be successful, for a long, long time.\n\nHowever, take a case like with your parents. They didn't grow up particularly wealthy or safe. They don't see those direct benefits the way some white people do. How could they possibly benefit?\n\n-By association: More wealthy white people also means more middle-class white people. That's more white people in professions like cops, teachers, social workers - people who can have a huge influence over someone's life. You can get some real benefits from someone like that seeing you as \"like them,\" and being the same race makes it more likely for that person to see themselves in you.\n\n-And through systemic racism: Racism built into the structure of a thing a long time ago that persists regardless of the ideologies of the individuals within it. Medical system is a great example - white male bodies were and are the standard doctors are taught on. Symptoms that show up differently for different bodies aren't as easily seen. That leads to better outcomes for white people medically by nature of their race, even if the doctor you see isn't white.\n\nThese are benefits that all white people in the US will get at some point that people of color see a lot less frequently.\n\nNow, I would like to address one more part of what you said here. You say that it's wrong for white people to be alienated on the basis of their race, and I agree with that broadly. But it is not alienating to suggest that white people own the fact that they see systemic benefits from historical racism. It is not alienating to suggest that white people may not see the ways they perpetuate racism themselves. It is not alienating to suggest that white people get benefits that people of color do not.\n\nThat's just acknowledging a truth. The alternative is to hide ourselves from it and pretend like we don't see these benefits. And if we do that, we'll never reach the point where we don't benefit from a long history of racial oppression. Ultimately, it means we end up alienating people of color. That's not great.",

There are very few things in life that are more risky than crime. If the reward wasn't so high, or if the reward for living life fairly and within the bounds of acceptable society rose to match or even exceed the life of crime, then crime statistics will drop immensely. Creating such a society would be difficult, to say the least, but focusing on preventative justice over punitive justice is one among many steps needed to achive it. Punitive justice does nothing except feel good. The risk of crime goes up, a little, but not substatially enough for it to ever really matter. If your situation is desperate enough it wouldn't matter even if every petty crime was punished with execution. The consequences for not acting would be death or worse anyways.",

But if you are going to still hold to it, then the correct course of action would be to test it (although testing social theories like this is a pain, and can very easily become immoral). Also, it's not really *my* theory, that was a bit misleading. It's what I believe to be the case, but it's actually a fairly common view among philosophers and reasearches of the social sciences (though, of course, there are critics and competing theories, this is just one of the more popular ones).\n\nWhat's wrong with punishing someone that's done something awful, you ask? It doesn't help anyone. That's what. It's pointless. It's an act of emotion in a world where systems are king. A properly functioning system can steer behavior towards what we want, while acting on our emotions rarely helps, and can often make things worse. The biggest advantage to being human is our rational mind. To discard that, ever, is a mistake. Punitive justice is nothing more than an systemic emotional reaction. \n\nPreventative justice, actually, you know... *prevents* crime. That's what it was designed to do. That's what it focuses on, and that's what it does. It works. Norway isn't the only country to implement it (though I think we're the ones with the most comprehensive system - I could be wrong though)\n\nHow could punishing evil dooers possibly be more important than preventing further evil? If that was someone's honest opinion (untwisted by rationalizations), then I wouldn't be able to call them a good person. That is why the argument *has* to be about wether such a system is effective or not. The moment one agrees that punitive justice actually does nothing but feel good is the moment one give up any sort of moral superiority.\n\nPunishing someone who killed 14 children is not more imporant than keeping someone else from killing another 14 children. I'm sure we can agree on that. So the question 'So what?' is inherently thoughtless.\n\nThe state shouldn't practice *vengence*. It should practice *justice*.

We have violence - even organized crime. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we don\u2019t have are \u201cbystander deaths\u201d and \u201ccollateral damage\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are indeed other countries where violence is as high - they\u2019re \u201cdeveloping\u201d countries where the value of life is much lower, because they don\u2019t have the infrastructure and investment to be able to provide the same quality of life.\n\n\n\n\nThe US is totally unique in having both more than enough money to do it, and all the other trappings of an advanced \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation - except for life expectancy, where you drop hugely, and gun ownership, which pulls your violence levels *way* up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you absolutely can - the Australian buyback scheme is the archetypal example. They offered a fair rate and reduced their gun massacres to zero overnight. \n\n\n\nLiterally only 1 since - and he was openly and publicly inspired by American examples, I think he cited 3 or 4 of your mass killers. So there\u2019s an argument that they failed *because* you won\u2019t buy back the guns - not because they\u2019re now \u201cinfected\u201d because they had guns in the past.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you guys don\u2019t see is the military industrial complex - because it\u2019s built into your economy. FDR tried to warn you. \n\n\n\nBut now the NRA and the rightwing press make more money than the rest of you combined and use that money to lobby your government and spout lies in the media - and you guys now all believe them.\n\n\n\n\nNo one else in the world does, though - we all live in reality.\n\n\n\n\nOh and - every other nation on earth has exactly the same tech as the US - it\u2019s the age of information, baby - in fact in lots of instances, better tech. \n\n\nThere\u2019s no avalanche of 3D printed or homemade guns anywhere in the world except - you guessed it - the USA!\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if telling people they have a right to own (but not safely use) a deadly weapon, they go out of their way to do so, regardless of what should be their concerns, like safety.
