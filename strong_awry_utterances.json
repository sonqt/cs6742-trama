Want to make the next Facebook? Humanitarian. Loan people money for a car? Humanitarian. Loan people money for tractors and drought resistant seeds? ...  Point being almost every market activity is humanitarian because it increases the welfare of consumers.\n\nActivism is much more marketing than it is anything else and marketing is a transaction cost, which is to say it doesn't change welfare other than the resources it takes to produce. From that perspective you need to have a party who is willing to gain more from the activism than the resources it takes to change people's minds. Chances are that activism will leave you poor because generally the people who want social and cultural change are people who are most marginalized by society and thus have little to give and not much financing available to fund such activism.\n\nSo basically humanitarianism almost always has a profit potential (which is to say you can charge enough of a difference between cost and demand to live off of) while activism has a good chance at leaving you poor.",

Man is weak and has no natural weapons. Logically then, the bear is superior\". Well, at some point some of our ancestors figured that \"fuck that, maybe the bear *is* bigger and stronger, but we *ought* not to have to run for our lives every time a bear shows up. So let's change things so that it's the bears who have a reason to worry\". And so our ancestors scratched their heads a little, tied a sharp rock to a stick and found a way to keep the bears at bay. And later they found a way to fire lead at the bear in such a way that even a child could defend themselves against one, if decently trained.\n\nSo the same goes for this subject matter. Yeah, okay, women are generally physically weaker, and men can have sex and not have to give birth to a child afterwards, but so what about it? We can shape our environment and make things more like we want them to be, rather than how they are. Damn near everything about the environment of a modern person is unnatural. Cities for instance are incredibly artificial and only exist because we decided we want to be able to live that way and took steps towards it. Without support cities would collapse; you can't grow enough food on your flat's balcony.\n\nIn general there are plenty reasons to disregard nature. Physical strength for instance is next to irrelevant these days. I go to the gym regularly, am well muscled, and about the only practical use I have for it is replacing the bottle on the office water cooler.\n\nThere also are plenty reasons to go against the \"natural\" state of things. Consider that for instance programming only requires a brain, and that exceptional skill is rare. If we stop from discouraging half the population from pursuing careers in programming we would avoid discouraging those who have the right mindset for the job but didn't pursue it for reasons that have nothing to do with the ability to do it.",

After controlling for all the stuff OP mentions, there is a still a gap.  That it is smaller (~95 cents, iirc) is completely irrelevant, because the 77 number never should have come up.  ~~Any gap between women and men that persists after controlling for all the stuff OP mentions, is unjustified sexism.~~\n\n(Here's a source to get started for those interested: http://blog.dilbert.com/post/114055529676/my-verdict-on-gender-bias-in-the-workplace.)\n\nEDIT: I regretted the last sentence on the pay gap as soon as I hit submit, but left it because I usually regret edits, too.  I stand by my main point that the pay gap arguments that OP makes are fallacious for similar reasons as the slut-shaming arguments are fallacious.  OP was not denying that there was a pay gap or that the pay gap was due to sexism, but rather denying that it matters.  The 77 cent gap doesn't matter, but the 95 cent gap does.  That women are, on average, biologically different from men, does not imply that individuals ought to be treated differently because of their sex.",

As long as there is a gun culture there will be guns everywhere along with gun deaths. If the assault rifle is the ferrari of guns then banning the high end will decrease the level of gun culture and allow for a change in how people view guns which hopefully will trickle down to handgun ownership and decrease the total amount of guns which will decrease the gun related deaths.

You can talk about this in terms of Darwinism which is I guess where they're coming from here, but we don't leave disabled people to die for the same reason I don't think eating meat is right - It's unnecessarily cruel.\n\nIt means that we need high quality proteins to sustain our body expenditures. The moment where animals started to eat meat, is the moment where large and quality brains and skeletal structure started to form. Suddenly the mammals didn't have to spend all the  time eating to sustain such a massive body and brain and be literally prey for others.\n\nTalking about prey. The hunting of animals is another benchmark for humans (well ancient animal like ancestors of humans). Once we started eating meat, we had to start hunt for food. That means we had to adapt to run fast, be strong and most importantly be clever.\n\nSome herbivores are by leagues faster than carnivores. Which offcourse means we needed to use our brains to kill them. Starting to form packs, cornering the animals, using tools to hunt for the animals, etc... None of our society would be possible if we didn't hunt animals. \n\n&gt;It's a way to control the population of animals\" - I'm not incredibly well researched on this, but I'm almost certain that the population of animals we eat is down to the fact that there's a high demand for their meat, not the other way around. And even if that was wrong, literally eating them seems a bit of a strange solution.\n\nAs twisted as it sounds. Us eating animals is ensuring strong and steady population of those animals. Think about animals that are going to go extinct and then tell me how many of those animals are we actively eating? The only thing I can think of are whales specific to Pacific\n\n&gt;\"It's what we've always done\" - Literally not an argument. Until 100 years ago we hadn't figured out basic hygiene standards in hospitals.\n\nLet's formulate it bit better. Our genes developed before the agricultural revolution. Our bodies are literally programed to function effectively on the diet consisting of meat. Problems such as diabetes, heart problems, obesity wasn't an issue until we started to grow crops, process sugar and salt. Our body simply doesn't work in an optimal way to adjust for those factors as of yet.\n\nFurthermore people who don't eat meat are at higher risk of having various mental issues, by having a chemical imbalance in brain. (Body does not know how to properly adjust if meat is not included in your diet)\n\nNot to mention various other problems. Such as narcolepsi, insomnia, weakened and imparired senses, and other problems that arise if you don't have enough sustained long-lasting energy that our body build specifically from meat. Etc, etc... So better way to phrase this criticism would be.\n\nBecause our body doesn't know how to function properly without meat.\n\nOkay, so why should we eat meat now. In todays world, where we don't really NEED meat to survive. You can get all the esentials without meat. But you need to do a proper research. You need to carefully eat things that give you the most ammount of quality protein, and you should also have special food supplements to avoid the vast majority, if not all the problems you get from not eating meat.\n\nBut, and this is a big but. Eating meat is still the most optimal way to get yourself into the best health you can possibly have. Which is the single most important thing you have.\n\n",

It's up to their *judge*ment.\n\nNow you can whine and be all like \"But that's not fair.\" And then realize life isn't fair. We don't punish in proportion to other crimes. Each case is judged on its merits. With the goal of rehabilitation in mind, if a sentence of two years for woman committing the same crime as a man that received a five years sentence discourages each of them enough from committing anymore crime, then the sentence has done its job.\n\nBasically, for the same reason a first-time offender can get a lighter sentence than a multiple offender, judges have the discretion to assign sentences based on how likely the person is to commit future crimes, or not.",

The legal system is not free to run; you have to pay taxes in order for it to work, but that's not renting: that's the definition of ownership. \n\nWhat you seem to think ownership means is to have control of something that is protected not by the legal system but your own power. However, that concept is what is referred to as sovereignty, not ownership. And yes, usually only governments are considered sovereign, since most individuals don't have or particularly want armies.  \n\nEdit: Since people keep raising it, I mean that ownership is a legal claim, not that all legal claims are ownership.

My biggest fear would be that this would incentivize men to relinquish their responsibility to use birth control.  There would be absolutely no downside for them.  It is also a rule that would be completely unenforceable unless a man signed a contract prior to engaging in sex with a female, and I doubt this is practical or that many women would agree with this.  The stakes are just too high to risk it.   The whole thing becomes a big mess legally and turns into he said, she said.  I could totally picture unethical men pressuring women to have sex without birth control promising they will be there if something happens and then backing out when the reality sits in.\n\nNow I agree that this sucks for men, but I don't really see a workable alternative that would make sure societies children are provided for.  My honest hope is that in the future, we improve on birth control and even come up with a \"default\" method that makes us only able to have children if we actively choose to.

If so, what would that look like? \n\nAnd unless we plan on giving him life in prison or executing him, at some point he will leave prison. How does locking him up with other criminals for a couple decades or whatever then releasing him back onto the street completely unemployable, hated, and in all likelihood alone *reduce the chance of him reoffending*. Why should we believe that whatever compelled him to act like that the first time will be resolved? \n\nThere is obviously some level of punitive justice that is necessary to disencentivize behavior. But it should be about making it not worth it. Not making the victim feel vindicated. \n\nIn the podcast I linked, there was a normal productive man that had to get brain surgery. Due to a complication, his brain went haywire became a pathological deviant. 20 years ago we would have had no way to tell he was suffering from a brain malfunction. We would see a pedophile and treat him accordingly. Now that science is beginning to catch up and we are able to identify and *treat* more underlying conditions, we should begin to focus on treatment rather than blame.\n\n*edit sentence",

            "text": "&gt; what the heck is XYZsplaining other than just being me and having an opinion\n\nIn the original article (http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/13/opinion/op-solnit13) mansplaining was characterizing a very specific phenomenon: the way certain men will blithely and patronizingly assume they're more informed on a topic than a given woman they're talking to.  I've seen this, many women I know have seen this a LOT.  It gave us all a good laugh and caused us to think about the social patterns underlying such things, as good observational comedy does.\n\nIt's a general thing: subconscious assumptions and tacit social trends.  I don't mean to sidestep the question of what to do when you're accused of it, but I do want to mention that a specific person being accused of it isn't really the point.  It's a bigger-picture thing.\n\nThen, this term got taken on to mean something else: The way people will speak up about something they couldn't possibly have knowledge of: The *subjective experience* of another group of people. For instance: \"Black people shouldn't be scared of the police.\"  If a white person says that, it's commenting on information they couldn't have except from talking to a Black person, so it's always less informed than just asking a Black person directly.  \n\n&gt; what can I do to participate, trying to be an ally, to avoid the accusation, which once made completely terminates any further legitimacy of my comments?\n\nDon't subconsciously assume women/etc. don't know something that you know, and don't tell people what their own subjective experiences are or should be.  More generally, when you're having a discussion with women/etc., specifically ask them about their expertise and give them chances to talk.  Personally, I can be a pedantic dude, and I hang around a lot of feminists and other social justice folks, but I have never been accused of anythingsplaining in my life.  I assume one reason for this is that I go out of my way to ask things I don't know of my friends and colleagues, and to give them a chance to speak.  It goes a long way to just say things like, \"You may know more about this than me, but I think...\"\n\n &gt; if the accusation that I'm XYZsplaining is made, what can I do to re-enter the conversation and not just be some privileged guy asserting his right to be heard at all times in all places?\n\nWell first, figure out if you agree with the idea that you've done one of the above things, and if you have, apologize.  If you feel you haven't, and if the relationship is important to you, then keep your mouth shut (though maybe bring it up later outside the heat of the moment).  If you feel you haven't and the relationship ISN'T important to you, then do whatever you want.  I suggest just asking for clarification.\n\nEither way, just don't phrase things like an asshole.  If you're accused of telling women how they feel and respond by saying \"You're wrong in feeling I did that,\" then that's obviously the start of a vicious cycle.  ",

It appears from the Politifact page that PV did get real audio from a real Democrat employee, but that doesn't mean everything about the videos was honest and aboveboard. \n\nMy understanding (granted, a cursory one, as this isn't an issue I've been focusing on) of the Acorn scandal is that Project Veritas recorded an Acorn employee helping somebody get the papers straightened out for an underage prostitute, but what they didn't show is that he immediately called the police as soon as the client left. That guy got canned too.

But we don't have to specify certain protected grounds on which you can't fire someone, but rather define grounds on which you CAN fire someone without having to pay them (i.e. they were stealing from you, or they assaulted a customer/employee, etc.).\n\nDefine a criminal punishment.  I say this because if you get expelled from university for an academic offense such as plagiarism the consequences that flow from this are purely academic.  Your accountant doesn't care that you plagiarized on an essay.  Your community doesn't care.  Its like a penalty in baseball.  Once the player is out of the game, no one cares about a penalty call made.\n\nRape on the other hand, everyone cares about.

I see the problem with factory farming, where the life of the animal is a bad life, but cows raised on pasture and humanely killed enjoy a net positive life compared to never having been born at all.\n\nI'm not sure that the positioning of the negative affects really matters, either. If everyone stopped drinking, millions of deaths might be prevented yearly (I found a stat that 88000 deaths in the US each year are caused by alcohol consumption, if that rate held worldwide it would be 2 million deaths).

Even when foods are labelled \"organic\" or \"free range\" only means the farms will take the most direct short cut to fulfill the criteria needed (such as free range only means the animals cannot be confined for at least PART of the day). Even if you managed to find a farm that is humane, slaughter houses also cause problems socially in areas where they are situated (such as often people with low income are left with these slaughtering jobs, and they found crimes rates and violence often go up in these areas). In my opinion the only humane way to kill and eat an animal would be through hunting or if you had a small farm just for your own consumption, because as soon as you want to make a profit animal welfare goes out the window. \n\nUnlike alcohol, the impact of these large scale animal farming is just terrible for the environment, whether it be the methane or land they take up for pasturing or indirectly through the corn they need for feed, the consequences is global not personal. If everyone quit meat it will benefit EVERYBODY whereas if you quit alcohol it's probably only beneficial for yourself.\n\nI have been a meat eater all my life but as I got older I am finding it harder and harder to justify eating meat.

I do think that most aspects of gender have at least some degree of causal connection with the biology of the associated sex- i.e., people with female DNA will, because of that DNA, have more of the traits associated with the female gender than people with male DNA, and vice versa. \n\nWhat on earth is \"male DNA\" or \"female DNA\"?  Are you talking about chromosomes?  If so, what about chromosomes should relate to the outcomes you're talking about?\n\n&gt;  Thinking and learning about those specific issues is where I began to encounter, and become suspicious of, the concept of gender identity. Essentially, my objection is as follows: when constructing their identity, people should ignore, as best they can, concepts of gender, and instead base their sense of self solely upon their tastes, beliefs, traits, etc.\n\nWait, this last sentence contradicts itself.  For instance, I like pink.  That's feminine.  Do you think I shouldn't have any opinion whatsoever about pink, because liking pink is a gendered trait?  \n\nI'm also confused about this idea of \"constructing\" an identity.

DNA can be described as male if it contains the XY chromosomes, and as female if it contains the XX chromosomes. \n\n\"If so, what about chromosomes should relate to the outcomes you're talking about?\"\nSome of the connections are relatively simple, some are quite complex. I don't claim to know what all the connections are, or how strong they are. But the fact that some connection exists is pretty hard to dispute. One of the clearer, less controversial types of connections: DNA determines what sex hormones you are shaped by. These hormones have a profound effect upon development and personality. For example, a strong causal connection has been shown to exist between testosterone levels and aggressiveness. Aggressiveness is typically viewed as a masculine trait, thus DNA has some impact upon at least one gendered trait. \n\n\"Wait, this last sentence contradicts itself. For instance, I like pink. That's feminine. Do you think I shouldn't have any opinion whatsoever about pink, because liking pink is a gendered trait?\"\nNo. I think that you shouldn't feel any obligation to like or dislike pink because of your gender, nor should any others push you to like or dislike pink because of your gender. \nAnd I don't see the contradiction.\n\n\"I'm also confused about this idea of \"constructing\" an identity.

First off, I'm sort of using something like a shorthand when I talk about identity and its formation, because it would take too long to fully describe those two things.\nOur identities are constructed around our tastes and experiences. Our interactions with other people make up a huge part of our experiences, and they influence our tastes, so yes, our interactions with people have great impact upon our identities. Part of what I was getting at is that people should do their best not to enforce gender roles.\nWe can also influence our own sense of self, however, and again, when doing so, it would be best if we did so in accordance with our own preferences and in pursuit of our own goals, rather than in alignment with the arbitrary concepts of gender.

I'm quite sure that there are many Republicans who disagree with you. On issue number one, several Repubs -- including Ted Cruz and Orrin Hatch -- condemned Trump's false equivalency statement on Twitter where he refused to call out the white nationalists specifically. On number three, they are very pro-gun but it is dishonest to frame that as being pro-murder (it's like asserting that being pro-car legalization makes you pro-vehicular manslaughter).\n\n&gt; their foreign policy is conducted by alt-right extremists, traditional aggressive Republicans and a thin skinned bully. \n\nHow many? Do you believe *every* Republican fits into one of these categories?\n\nPoint I'm going for here is that as a whole, Republicanism is a very vast spectrum of ideas and people. I think your post would be a lot more helpful if you specifically described certain sections or parts of the party, or if you specifically focused on alt-righters in the party; you're going to alienate a lot of conservatives if you just paint them all with a broad brush, and I don't think those of us who are going against the Nazis and the more radical parts of the party can afford to be selective of who is on our side given the predicament we are in.\n\nAlso, if I may:\n\n&gt; and their recent laws which made it legal to hit protesters with their cars\n\nSource and context?",

            "text": "I think other people have mentioned this, but the main problem here is not having a concrete definition. \n\nI see mansplaining being used in two circumstances.\n\nMansplaining, def 1: the act of explaining something that doesn't need to be explained in a condescending manner based on a sexist assumption. \n\nSo, it's not having an argument. It's about being told something that you already know. An example: a male doctor tells their female colleague \"That's what we use for taking blood pressure.\" The female doctor knew that. In that scenario, you have two options. \n\n1. You silently just take it. \"You're right. Thanks.\" A lot of women choose this route because it's \"polite\" and \"lady-like.\"\n\n2. You snap at them. \"I already knew that. I don't need you telling me.\" This is the reaction that provokes the word mansplaining in the moment. \n\n\n\nMansplaining, def 2: the act of confidently and incorrectly explaining something and disregarding the other person based on a sexist assumption that men know more\n\nThis one, I have a concrete example from my life. It is, without a doubt, the stupidest conversation I've ever had. I had a guy tell me that periods only last 3 days. As a woman, I felt fairly certain that this was not a universal fact. \n\nSo, I started to say, \"Well, that's not true. I--\" And he cut me off. \"No, it is true. I learned about this in 6th grade from my dad, and I have a sister. Women only get their period for 3 days. Any longer than that and they're just lying to get out of stuff.\"\n\nAny time I tried to correct him, he would not listen. Despite the fact that I, a real human woman, was sharing my experience, he felt that he was more knowledgeable. \n\nAfter a certain point in an argument, you have to walk away when you realize you can't change the other person's mind. If the word had existed at the time, I think calling it mansplaining would have stopped him from interrupting me and maybe made him think about what I was saying/why he was disregarding me. Yes, it would derail the argument. But that would be a good thing. He was just clinging to being right, despite logic and reasoning telling him otherwise. It was more than condescending. It was sexist to assume he would know more, and worse still, it was incorrect. And he didn't give me the opportunity to share my thoughts. \n\nThat moment, to me, is mansplaining at its core. It's pointing to a pattern where some men believe they know more about a topic than a woman, even when evidence points to the contrary. Whether that woman already knows it or has a different opinion/view/facts about it, the internalized belief on the man's side is the problem. ",

It has a ton of different effects depending on your mood, attitude, and environment, and I get that. And you're honestly pretty right - it would probably come down to several different 'alcohol replacement' mixtures varying from some being more stimulating, some being more relaxing, and so forth. \n\nI mean I know my argument does verge pretty closely to drug liberation in order to lessen the overall prevalence of alcohol, but I think something that would be more marketable and easily accepted than simply 'end all drug laws' specifically revolves around altering alcohol itself.

That is, the risk of someone getting hit, even if the driver is moving slowly and trying to be careful, is far too high. Cops and emergency workers have been killed in this manner.\n\n&gt;You would also be comparing an accident vs malicious intent.\n\nNo, I'm comparing an accident vs. negligence. An accident would be if someone is driving down the street and a pedestrian unexpectedly stepped or jumped in front of them. You're talking about someone in a two ton car purposefully driving toward people that are blocking their path. Even doing so 'carefully' is still incredibly negligent behavior on the behalf of the driver, even if they don't maliciously intend to hit anyone. They are basically saying 'my need to get down this street trumps the safety of the people in the street'\n\n&gt;I'm trying to focus on maliciously holding up traffic.\n\n'Maliciously' holding up traffic doesn't physically injure or kill the person in the car. Carefully trying to maneuver past people standing in the road in the hopes they'll move out of the way *can physically injure or kill that person'. Does a person deserve to be injured or killed, intentionally or not, because they delayed someone? \n\n&gt;You could also focus on the mob aspect and the personal fear for life.\n\nUnless the people in the car have reason to believe their life is in danger (riot, people beating on the car, threatening them with weapons, etc) then merely 'they're blocking the road' is not grounds to put the protesters in danger and personal fear for *their* lives. Even if they are in fear for their lives (the drivers), just ramming your 2 ton car through pedestrians- slowly or not- is not recommended and may get you jail time if you cannot prove adequate cause, and rightfully so.",

But here's how it could go:\n\nChange public opinion far enough, and SCOTUS will rediscover those words \"a well regulated militia\". Pass laws. Law-abiding people will turn in their guns, manufacturers will have to stop making and selling. As criminals are arrested, more guns will be removed from the system, their supply will start drying up. Some family members will rat out remaining owners.  As now-criminal gun-owners die, some of their heirs will turn in the guns.  It will get to the point where gun ownership is counterproductive: brandishing or firing a gun gets you in as much trouble as the criminal attacking you is in.  And hunting and target-shooting have stopped.\n\nIt may take a century, we may never get 100% of the guns out, it will be slow and hard, but it's the right thing to do.\n\nNot getting to 100% doesn't make the effort worthless.  Countries that have 1/5 of our guns per capita tend to have 1/5 of our gun-deaths per capita.

            "text": "I'll let others continue to address your main point, but I'd like to push back on your statement that \"guns should't be seen as the go to self-defense method, martial arts should be.\" \n \n \nLet me preface this by saying that I am a 26 year old army vet who's trained a bit(not competitively) in MMA, and the Army's Combatives program. I am in pretty good shape, strong, and I can hit relatively hard. \n   \n   \nThat being said, the idea that someone, healthy or otherwise, could expect to RELY on hand to hand combat skills to defend themselves and their family in the real world is unbelievably naive. There is a reason police have various tools available to them with escalating levels of force. This is because there are uncontrollable variables. Number, size, strength, skill, determination, and intent of the opponents, weapons, whether you are defending only yourself or your partner or children, the list goes on. Hand combat skills are only useful in a small minority of these situations. A firearm however, is a great equalizer. Facing 4 NFL lineman sized motherfuckers intent on raping your wife? The Glock on your hip is the only hope you've got of stopping that. I don't care how many times you've seen karate kid. \n    \n    \nMOST IMPORTANTLY, firearms carried by law abiding citizens have the potential to end potentially harmful or deadly situations BEFORE THE SITUATION EVEN STARTS. In the above example, if you draw a firearm on those guys, the entire situation likely ends without a pull of the trigger. The mere THREAT of deadly force is sufficient to stop most opponents and hold them until police can arrive. If you had tried to fight them off, best case scenario, the police arrive quickly enough that you've just been battered a bit and nothing too awful happened....but you(the victim) still got hurt.\n    \n   \nI will partially accept part of the notion you mentioned when you stated that \"Well the 90yo women in a wheel chair needs to realize that a gun won't either. Like I said, by the time she draws it and cocks it, she's dead unless the person attacking her is also a 90yo woman.\"\n    \n    \nIf we have accepted the fact that deadly force could be imparted on you very rapidly (regardless of your age), what in the world makes you think that your ability punch, kick, or grapple with any proficiency would be useful at all? The answer is, it wouldn't be. There is no true defense against deadly force applied correctly. If the potential for deadly force exists however, but isn't applied instantly (ie pre-planned assassination) then a firearm MAY be useful for defense. \n    \n  \nWhere martial arts would be effective and useful is against non-lethal force (think bar fight with non-armed opponent). This is a situation where even a law abiding citizen would not be justified in utilizing their firearm for defense so there is certainly value to having the hand-to-hand skills.\n   \nLook, I wish we lived in a world where firearms were not needed, but we don't. Something similar to my above example happened a mile from my house not that long ago. A young woman was at home in her apartment, 2 big dudes shattered the glass porch door, came in, and raped her. You think martial arts could have stopped that? Not a snowflake's chance in hell. \n    \nA former roommate of mine in college prevented a robbery of our home(and potential bodily injury to himself) with his firearm. It was late at night and someone walked right in the front door. My roommate said \"What the fuck are you doing?\" To which the intruder repled \"Fuck you\" and continued to enter. Roommate stood up, drew his firearm, and the intruder ran. \n    \nAnother man I know got into a shootout in his home with intruders and killed 2 of them, saving the lives of his wife and 2 children. Made front page of the newspaper. \n    \nSo yeah, guns aren't good defense tools...right. ",

Do you think they could have arrested him?  Confiscated his weapons?\n\nAs a libertarian, do you want them to be able to have him involuntarily committed at that point?\n\nThis is one of the most asinine criticisms of the situation.\n\n&gt;I just want to ask why the idea of arming teachers, staff or even volunteers or guards at schools is such a bad idea?\n\nYou do know the school had an armed guard, right?  And as you noted, there were sheriffs who refused to get into a shootout with the gunman.\n\nBut, sure, let's take a look at putting more guns in schools.\n\nTo start with, the shooting in Florida lasted for six minutes from the first shot to the last.  In *six minutes* this man killed seventeen children.  How many minutes do you think get shaved off by adding more guns into the school?  Even if *half* of the teachers decide to be trained, what's  the gain?\n\nIf it's known which teachers have guns, and who the guards and \"volunteers\" are, do you not think a shooter would begin shooting in classrooms without a gun?  And if that's an issue you want to fix, how do you hide which classrooms have guns?\n\nFor it to be any benefit would require that the guns be easily accessible, which also means fairly obvious.\n\nAnd when do you think the teachers would begin to act?  Remember that you're on a clock, seventeen dead in six minutes.  Even *with* training ordinary people (by which I mean \"people who are not psychopahts\") tend to freeze up in a combat situation.  This includes *soldiers*.  There is a huge psychological imperative *not* to kill other people.\n\nSo, would teachers wait until they see the gun?  How would they see the gun if he goes into a class without an armed teacher to open fire?  That means they're going to have to wait for the first shot.  Six minutes on the clock, 360 seconds.  How fast does someone work up the courage to go in guns blazing?\n\nBut let's say the kid's stupid and tries to shoot where a teacher is armed.  Either the teacher is trained to shoot preemptively (which I'm hoping you know is *really bad*), or has to wait until a threat is imminent.\n\nAnd how secure do you think those guns will be?  My wife is a teacher, even with \"active shooter response training\", she's five foot six, taking a gun from her would not be difficult if she weren't expecting it.  Which either means she *never* has to let a kid within arms length of her, or she has to keep the gun locked up.  But a gun locked up defeats the purpose, it doesn't give the quick response you need.\n\nSix minutes, remember.\n\n&gt;I think allowing administration the option of arming themselves and competent staff members is an important step in eliminating the culture of school shootings forever.\n\nWhy do you think that showing kids that guns are a viable solution to problems, a sign of *power* and *dominance*, a way to enforce your will against others, is going to reduce school shootings?\n\nWhat you're imagining is that a kid pulls a gun and immediately Dirty fucking Harry is there drawing down on him, double-tap, badass.  That's not how shootings work.\n\nThey're messy, chaotic, dangerous.  Our trained soldiers are often unable to identify civilian from foe in these situations, it's not going to be any easier in a school where kids are screaming and dying.  More guns in the hands of amateurs, even semi-trained amateurs, aren't going to reduce the number of bullets flying.\n\n&gt;(Edit) I do not believe banning all semiautomatic weapons is a valid argument because almost every modern weapon is semi automatic including handguns so mentioning specific styles or platforms to discuss would be more appreciated \n\nI'm not sure why \"it would also apply to handguns\" makes an argument against semi-automatic weapons.

As a parent you make all sorts of decisions for them without their consent, many of them may seem emotionally painful to them at the time, even for stupid reasons. Some decisions they may come to resent you for over time, when they\u2019re all grown up. Either way, it\u2019s your decision as a parent to make, not the child\u2019s. That\u2019s fundamental to how parenting works.\n\nAs for the physical aspects itself, I would begin by asking, are you a parent? I was honestly surprised how dirty my son\u2019s manhood gets. Honestly it\u2019s gross. Even with a circumcision he still has plenty of extra skin that can hold onto all sorts of filth. There\u2019s a reason they say circumcision leads to decreased infection. It really is hard to keep clean at a young age. If you\u2019re not a parent, I\u2019m going to tell you something else about a two year old boy \u2014 they love to stick their hands down their diapers and play with their junk. It\u2019s gross and disgusting, because remember, he\u2019s still in diapers. If I can have him circumcised and avoid the possibility of an infection, that is a decision I will definitely make for him.\n\nFinally, I\u2019m 35 and have never regretted the loss of a bit of skin on my penis. I understand there are many nerve endings and I think to do it as an adult or even teen would lead to loss of sensation. I\u2019m not sure but I imagine it\u2019s so. But doing it at birth is a different story when your brain is still wiring itself up. I really don\u2019t believe I\u2019m missing any enjoyment from nightly activities. I think the pleasure I get is no less than what an uncircumcised man gets. Can we know for sure? No, but can you ever really know how other people experience the world? Maybe when I experience red you experience green, and how would we ever know? But in all honesty I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out.",

You being unable to relate to an activity reflects more on you than anything.  Find me a culture that doesn't enjoy shooting sports to some extent.  Shooting is a relatively unique activity in that in most of the disciplines; height, weight, age, and gender don't matter at all.  Everyone competes on an even playing field.  I also take issue with the concept that other countries have legally removed the right of a person to defend themselves and their family.

You have over 350 million guns in the country and every year, including suicide and accidents \\(Why not, just to inflate the stats, though I'm not sure you could argue those two uses are the original intended purpose? \"Hey check out my new invention, it kills you by accident!\"\\) 38,658 deaths in 2016, give or take. .011&amp;#37; of them being used for their intended purpose.\n\nThere are 260ish million cars in the US, lets pretend we all get our own personal teleporters.

People keep their cars, just in case they need to drive to work in an emergency, but generally they just spin em around the block for fun.

If you look at recent voting patterns from the past few elections, Trump got about as many votes as Mitt Romney and John McCain. The difference isn\u2019t with the republicans, it\u2019s with the democrats. In 2016, Hillary got significantly fewer votes than Obama did in either of his elections.\n\nSo the people we\u2019re talking about when someone says \u201cthis is why Trump got elected\u201d are not republicans. They\u2019re the democrats who decided not to vote democrat in 2016. I\u2019m one of those people. I voted democrat in every election of my life until 2016, and the reason is because I\u2019m a white male. And as a white male, it has been made crystal clear to me that I am the enemy of democrats.\n\nSo of course I\u2019m not gonna vote for them. I still didn\u2019t like Trump and so I still didn\u2019t vote for him (I went 3rd party instead), but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to vote democrat when democrats seem to have no regard for my interests whatsoever. And this is quite different than how I have felt about the Democratic Party historically. It\u2019s only in the past 4 or 5 years that I\u2019ve felt like they truly have turned their backs on anyone who isn\u2019t socially oppressed. \n\nSo when people say \u201cWhen you call people a racist you end up with Trump\u201d they aren\u2019t really referring to republicans. They\u2019re referring to the fact that a shitload of liberals are getting called racist these days by other liberals and it\u2019s driving them away. I\u2019m a textbook example of that phenomenon. It makes me sad to see what the Democratic Party has become because like I said, I used to be very supportive of their goals. But since their goals have shifted so much, I can\u2019t really say I\u2019m a supporter anymore. I don\u2019t really regret abandoning them in 2016. ",

They still have culture, it\u2019s just not like ours. \n\nShows like Dear White People arent hating on white people. Im white; ive never once gotten that from the show. What people of color who are active in civil rights fights want white people to realize is that doing nothing is aiding racism. Its not enough to simply not be racist, we have to actively fight for those people being oppressed by our society. Thats because we have the most power. So thats the first thing. And as for our culture, i dont think most white people even realize what our culture is. So for me, that feels pretty irrelevant.\n\n&gt;I also noticed that on Wikipedia if you search every form of racial pride, they are all considered positive things except for white pride, which is seen as negative and racist. Are white people just seen as inherently racist? Anyone can be racist, and no one is just born racist. I feel like this hate on white people will put us in an awful position down the road. \n\nWhite people are not seen as inherently racist. The problem is historically, theres never been a positive white pride movement. Its not needed. Historically white history and pride has dominated. Just look at s typical history class. Its all about white people. In the past, any white pride movement has been steered towards negatively affecting other races. The same cannot be said for other pride movements.

Another case is a woman \u201creporting her concerns\u201d about a man in the dressing room who claimed to identify as a woman.\n\nSo their data is suspect on the face of it and blurs the lines between \u201csexual predators\u201d and people who are just transgendered and want to use the bathroom.  That\u2019s without even getting into the methodology problems of just listing a bunch of incidents consistent with your point as \u201cevidence\u201d that transgendered-policies encourage assault.\n\nThe point here is that actual data is irrelevant to their argument.

Euthanasia should be a legal act that may be performed by a state on inconvenient babies that their parents have given up rights to, and that no one wants to adopt. And fetuses should be able to be terminated at any time should the mother wish it, because her right to a body without unwanted fetuses/babies inside of it is more useful to fulfilling socially relevant preferences than keeping babies and fetuses alive, who have no socially relevant preferences, and to pro-lifers, who have preferences that are so inconvenient to social fitness that they ought to be disrespected regarding their views on intrauterine life.\n\nI am neither right nor wrong in these views, because there are no meaningful moral standards outside of human preferences. We prefer rightness and wrongness into existence, and we enforce those preferences with the intensity with which we want to see them enforced. Moral standards do not exist separately from us.

            "text": "So, you're very wrong on this, and your article doesn't say what you want it to say for this. But, I'm going to ignore the fact that there are substantial economic and diplomatic benefits from more liberal immigration, even with rule breaking and assume I won't change your mind there. To that end, I'll focus exclusively on the cost efficiency question assuming we do want a substantial reduction in illegal immigration.\n\nThe biggest issue with a border wall is its not an effective deterrent. cost-effective response. To step into defence for an analogy, if you are facing an adversary that has a vast array of air-to-ground capabilities but few tanks/mechanized, the real deterrent is anti-air capabilities, not countermobility. Each investment in deterrence is a trade-off, and so the question is how effectively a deterrent really addresses the threat. Similarly, when assessing border controls, we want to talk about cost-effective mechanisms to address means of illegal transit. \n\nSo to start off, how do illegal immigrants enter the US? Well, it\u2019s difficult to measure, particularly since much of it remains undetected (obviously where it\u2019s successful). Moreover, most of them since the financial crisis enter by overstaying visas, not by crossing the border (stable at just under 250 000 annually since ~2007 vs about 150 000 annually crossing the border for years of available data.) See this [Centre for Migration Studies report](http://cmsny.org/publications/jmhs-visa-overstays-border-wall/) pg. 127. So on this, a border wall is misdirected - this isn't how most people get in. But what about for those who do enter? Well, human smuggling is a multi million dollar industry, and even where a wall might help - it only slows the crossing, as smuggler move undocumented immigrants in groups and invest in material to cross, including by focusing on the most porous parts of the wall. But worse, detection of these attempts would be worse because you can't see through a wall - meaning you'd have to substantially increase manpower as simply driving along such a border is consequently not enough to monitor it.\n\nBut for those crossing the border \u2013 well, the issue is at a long-time low. Additional investments now make less sense than they have historically, and while greater investment in tactical defences could theoretically make a difference in specific cases and apprehensions, similar investments in border security in the past (1990s and mid 2000s) have not significantly deterred immigration. Hardening borders in the 90s didn\u2019t result in a drop \u2013 in fact, although apprehensions increased from about 1M in 1990 to a high of almost 1.6M in 2000 ([CRS Border Security](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42138.pdf), 19), illegal immigration was not slowed and in fact continued to rise. But now (2015, latest available data), apprehensions are at 300 000 \u2013 its lowest point since the early 70s. \n\nThere was also a substantial bump in spending/fencing that coincided with the post-2007 decrease in apprehensions, but it\u2019s very difficult to tell to what degree this helped vs. fewer post-2008 financial crisis opportunities. I can link you more if you\u2019d like (depending on if you have access to Springer / a University library subscription?) But as I found this one available online sans paywall, see [Villarreal\u2019s paper here in Demography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4252712/) which found that the largest declines in migration were those seeking jobs in industries most hit by the recession. \n\nSo the question is \u2013 would a wall help? A piece by David Bier, an immigration policy analyst\u2013 from CATO which is known for its libertarian leanings, so take that into account as you will \u2013 released this [very critical article](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-wall-wont-workon the wall). He points to a variety of issues, from the problems of monitoring an opaque border (ie, you can see through a fence \u2013 not a wall), to the limits of technology (tunnel detection isn\u2019t very good yet), to maintenance (the fences\u2019 maintenance costs have been about 50% of their total costs over the past decade - a wall's maintenence would be much higher) and worst of all, if the hardening of tactical barriers in the 1990s is anything to go by, wouldn\u2019t likely have a substantial deterrent effect. Additionally \u2013 though I think this is from the CRS report \u2013 there\u2019s a question of trapping seasonal migrants in the US, preventing those illegal immigrants from re-entering Mexico, forcing them to set up permanent roots in the US.\n\nThere\u2019s, at the end of the day, a question of diminishing returns. Would recommend this Wilson Centre Report on the [State of the Border](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/mexico_state_of_border_0.pdf). The relevant section is Chapter 4,  but the conclusion is on page 116 or you can just glance at the highlights for the section on page 1. Their conclusion is that a concentration of border security resources at the border is misplaced (and a Trump wall would be a MASSIVE increase in the concentration of resources at the border). Instead, concentrating enforcement away from the border would be preferable, to slow the diminishing returns of further investment.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend this [Government Accountability Office report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/693488.pdf)  (Conclusion/recommendations on page 33) which assesses the CBP\u2019s process in implementing Trump\u2019s EO on the Wall. It argues that the CBP is going ahead without key information, bringing serious risks for a substantially increased cost for the wall.   I\u2019d also note the GOA has released a number of reports criticizing the CBP for failing to do a serious analysis of the effectiveness of new barriers, which is referenced in this report, but I can dig them up if you\u2019re interested.\n\n**TL;DR:** The wall would not be cost efficient. The problem of illegal immigration is at the lowest in half a century, and previous hardenings (90s especially) of tactical barriers failed to deter illegal immigrants. Those that do enter now usually do by overstaying visas, and those committed won't be stopped by a wall. The walls costs will be much higher, as along with much higher maintenance it will also require substantial increases in personnel to effectively monitor. Finally, we've reached a point of diminishing returns where further concentration of resources at the border isn't really helping. If you're really interested in decreasing the (already historic low) illegal immigration, spreading resources out within the US and in cooperation with Mexico in a sort of \"defence in depth\" approach is more likely to produce results.",

            "text": "I'm sorry, but people who think lab grown meat is a \"thing\" unfortunately have little experience in biological cell culture and have only been duped by reading non-scientific articles in newspapers like The New York Times and magazines like Wired about it. Maybe someone from the industry can correct me, but here's why I think it's (currently) BS due to the limitations of 2D cell culture, cell doubling time, reagent cost, and reagent sourcing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe #1 problem with lab grown meat is the throughput of standard cell culture techniques used by every biology lab around the world. All these labs are growing their cells on [flasks of various sizes](https://www.usascientific.com/productimages/greiner/main/advanced-tc-filter-flasks-m.jpg) but a very common one is a T75 flask, meaning it has 75 cm^(2) on which to culture cells. From a single T75 flask you can maybe get a max of 10 million cells, and that's pushing it. 10 million cells may sound like a lot, but consider that the average person is around 75 trillion cells, and you can start to see a problem. The sheer number of cells to even make a \\*single\\* patty is on the scale of billions of cells. Since 1 billion cells roughly fills up a 50 mL tube, I'd say a decent single patty requires around 2 billion cells - so 200 standard T75 flasks for one patty. A \\*typical\\* student or researcher is going to be changing cell media in anywhere from 1-20 flasks for his or her research. A full time lab tech who is paid by a department may be taking care of many many more flasks at a time for something like stem cell culture, but you only bother to hire a lab tech when you have so many dozens to hundreds of flasks to take care of that it would prevent your PhD students from getting any actual research done other than changing cell media. So producing just \\*one patty\\* of 2 billion cells from 200 flasks is basically going to require that you hire a full time lab tech to take care of the cells and grow them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you're serious about growing this patty and you ditch the T75 flasks and get something more efficient like a [cell factory](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LCD/product-images/LC-120300-NuncCO2-Incubator_04.tif-650.jpg) where you just stack larger flasks in a gigantic incubator. Doing that still won't change current limitations of 2D culture, cell doubling time, reagent cost and reagent source. Since we still culture cells in 2D, it's horribly inefficient in comparison to growing cells in 3D, greatly limiting the efficiency and yield. So why don't we just grow our cells in 3D? After all it'd help all biologists to have billions of cells to work with instead of millions, right? The problem here is the diffusion of oxygen to cells in the flasks. The typical distance thrown around for the diffusion limit of oxygen is 200 microns. Beyond this distance oxygen cannot diffuse far enough to keep cells alive and you need vasculature like capillaries to be carrying oxygen to your cells. So if you want to start culturing cells in 3D in \"tissues\" thicker that just 1/5 of a mm deep, you need to be creating some sort of vasculature to provide your cells with oxygen and nutrients. Creating 3D vasculature for cells is my area of research, so all I can say is good luck doing that on a massive scale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you've got the cell factory, lab tech, and have maybe even found a way to start culturing cells in roughly 3D volumes, awesome! That won't change the doubling time of your cells, or the cost of your reagents or your reagent source. Cells can only multiply so quickly to fill up your culture flasks. A C2C12 cell (a super common mouse muscle cell) doubles roughly every 12 hours. So currently every couple of days you need to take that one full flask of cells and \"split it\" into, say, 4 flasks of cells to give them more room to grow. If you find a way to lower the doubling time of the cells, you are going to have to be \"splitting\" your cells into flasks even more frequently, which takes more time than just changing the cell media you're feeding them with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you've got the cell factory, lab tech, have found a way to start culturing cells in roughly 3D volumes and have a cell line with a really fast doubling time. That won't change the cost of your reagents or your reagent source. So all those flasks you were growing your cells in require cell media. Cell media is just the broth that contains crucial proteins and nutrients cells need to grown outside of a normal body. As cells proliferate, they consume the nutrients in the media, turn it acidic and need it changed every so often. It's basically food and a diaper in one. You need to provide the cells with food, and you can't let the media get too acidic (dirty) so it needs to be changed. The problem with all of this cell culture stuff is that cell media is expensive. A single T75 flask takes maybe 20 mL of cell media at a time. So to get your 2 billion cells from 200 T75 flasks, you need 4L of media just to start the experiment. Around 500 mL of [C2C12 cell media](https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/US/en/Primary-and-Stem-Cells/p/000000000000185301/SkGM-Skeletal-Muscle-Cell-Growth-Medium-BulletKit) is going to run you at least $160, maybe less if you order in bulk as a company, but either way for your first round of cell media you're looking at 8 x $160 = $1280 for your first 4L of cell media. Keep in mind you'll probably have have to change this media at least once while your cells are doubling in all those flasks, so make it $2560. Throw in your tech's salary, CO2 costs, electricity costs to run your incubators and you're looking at maybe another $1000. **So it's \\~$3500 just to get your single patty.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you've got the cell factory, lab tech, have found a way to start culturing cells in roughly 3D volumes, have a cell line with a really fast doubling time and are okay paying a lot for cell media. This doesn't change **the ultimate final problem** **with cell culture - it depends on the slaughterhouse industry to even exist.** What am I talking about, you ask? Well where did you think all that cell media came from? One of the most crucial reagents in cell culture is [Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum). It is literally the blood taken from an unborn calf whose mother was slaughtered. Serum is the fluid component of blood that contains all those small proteins needed to culture cells, and a developing fetus contains loads of those precious, precious proteins. So to even have started this experiment you were indirectly buying the blood of unborn cows to even get to your patty and therein lies the ultimate irony - **the lab grown meat industry needs to industrial slaughter industry to even exist.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to your point of \" If this tech was prioritized and funded I can see a more sustainable agriculture future for humanity.\" The problem is is that this tech is and has always been prioritized by biologists ever since we started culturing cells decades ago. Additionally, it has always been \"funded\" but how much (more) is needed? Well it's difficult to say. Scientific research is slow. You do not necessarily solve problem A faster by throwing more money at it. This is because problem A is also dependent on current limitations of technology B. And technology B is hindered by limitations in method C. All these fields of scientific research are intertwined so typically an advance in one technology has a positive ripple effect into other areas. The downside to this is that even if you spend 10x more money on cell culture research than you currently are, you are not going to solve all the associated problems of cell culture. The thought that you can throw more money at research and solve all problems faster is to assume 9 pregnant women can produce a baby in 1 month. It is simply not true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat \\*could\\* make lab grown meat possible? Finding a way to produce all of those proteins like FBS \\*in vitro\\* just like we produce insulin for diabetics with modified bacteria. If there was a company that was able to produce cell culture media without the need for FBS, or found a way to make FBS synthetically, I would invest in it. That company would then provide at least one of the key limiting reagents needed for cell culture. But you're not going to see a NYT article about \"company creates synthetic FBS substitute\" because no one outside of the field would know what that is and what it implies. It is instead far more easy for the NYT or Wired to go to one of these \"lab grown meat\" companies, look at all their culture flasks and say \"wow this is the future\". Well it's currently not the future in my eyes, it's just a very time and cost inefficient way of growing you one patty and until the handful of limitations I mentioned above are addressed, it will continue to be BS.",

            "text": "So if cells double in 12 hours, the total target for the cell quantity you need to have in the system at any one time is the local consumption in any given 12 hour period in the area that you are growing for. Say you own South Texas Clean Meat company which grows and distributes meats to 10,000,000 people who consume on average 200grams every 12 hours, you\u2019d need around 2,000 tonnes of culture \u2018brewing\u2019 at any time, producing 2,000 tonnes of meat every 12 hours. You could probably do this in a single large facility and although not specified in your post i am going to assume it would consume roughly 4000 tonnes of \u2018feed\u2019 per 2000 tonnes created. \n\nConsider then for a moment what this replaces. Let\u2019s break it down as:\n500 tonnes of chicken, 500 tonnes Lamb, 1000 tonnes beef. \n\nAt 1kg meat per chicken, this is 500,000 chickens every 12 hours or 1,000,000 per day. Meat chickens take roughly 40 days to grow, process and distribute meaning you\u2019d need 40,000,000 chickens in the pipeline. At 10,000 chickens per hectare (free range) this is 4,000HA of land. At 115g of food per chicken per day, you also need 4,600Tonnes of chicken food per day or around 9.2kg of feed per kg of meat produced. You also have to manage around 4,000 tonnes of guano per day and dispose of 1,000,000 carcasses. \n\nFor beef, to produce 1,000 tonnes per 12 hours, and assuming an average of age of 2 years and weight of 1000kg at slaughter, producing roughly 500kg of saleable meat in various cuts you need 4,000 beasts per day with around 3,000,000 in the pipeline. Each consumes 3% of its bodyweight in food per day so you need around 45,000 tonnes of feed per day to produce that beef (possibly more, as I have assumed linear growth from 0 to 1000kg over 2 years). Assuming they all live on feedlots (yes I know, many are grass fed, but this brings its own issues) and are stocked at around 500 per hectare you need 6,000 hectares of land. You also have to handle 40,000 tonnes of cow pat and 4,000 carcasses per day. This is currently dumped in rivers and streams at huge cost to the environment. \n\nJust to reiterate, we feed chickens 9.2 times as much grain as they produce in meat and cows 23 times as much grain as they produce in meat!!\n\nThis new meat is so much more efficient at scale that we only harm ourselves by _not_ throwing money at solving the problems you raise (some of which I would wager are already solved). I love eating animal but if I could have the same taste and nutrition without the slaughter? FUCK YES. Maybe lab grown meat isn\u2019t much of a thing today, but it is definitely the future of meat. All I can say is if you\u2019re not solving the problems, get out of the way. \n\n",

If we're just talking about individual cases we'd focus on making adoption easier. But the democrats don't want these kids to be better off, they want them to be dead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComprehensive sex education? You mean like in Sweden where they made kids get naked and act out sexual acts? Maybe we should focus on school vouchers before we start forcing public schools to do x or y.

You're cutting off a part of the human body that has a definite and useful purpose\n2. (The more applicable one to my later argument against your CMV) - babies DO feel pain (believe it or not many don't understand this), and forcibly cutting the most sensitive part of your body when you're less than a day old is arguably pretty barbaric.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow - if you're a man and you have the balls to watch a video of the procedure, it's pretty impossible to not cringe, moan, and grab your dick just to make sure it's doing ok. But for the most part, men don't make this decision for their sons. Women do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Women\\* tend to prefer circumcised dicks - because they \"don't look as weird.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a very important part of this movement is men telling women to stop circumcising their sons. Women don't have penises. So they don't really (and can't really) understand the gravity of the procedure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I tell you to stop, and you don't really know that you're doing anything wrong, you'll tend to ask - why? Why should I stop? And hopefully, that's the start of a conversation. Why does it matter? Because it's awful - and we shouldn't do awful things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody wants to do awful things, and if they're made to be aware just how awful the thing is, they probably won't do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with the Gillette ad, and feminists just going up to men and saying \"Stop raping women\" is that the methodology of the message is really uncharitable and accusatory. If I go to every mother I know and say something like \"You're a terrible person because you circumcised your son and subjected him to the highest pain imaginable,\" she's going to get defensive, and it's not going to work. But we shouldn't circumcise because we shouldn't do awful things. And if we can't tell people to stop doing awful things, then we really can't stop awful things from happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: As /u/EatYourCheckers pointed out, many online communities and parenting subreddits with moms prefer to let their husbands make the decision. Just wanted to not be too disingenuous\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit 2**: I already fed one troll just to make a visible point about how people are commonly shamed, even by other men, for having this viewpoint.

Black people are a racial minority, they have historically been isolated and kept separate, and they are still oppressed today.  It's not unreasonable for them to want to carve out a little space for themselves, where they don't have to spend half their time explaining shit to whitey, or defending themselves against accusations.\n\n\" Racial equality can never happen if we are unwilling to look past race and interact with each other as humans first, and as white or black humans last\"\n\nWho bears more fucking responsibility to end racism?

However, I am humoring you for the sake of our audience.\n\nPlease illustrate to me how attraction to someone who looks like a woman with breasts and a vagina is not transphobic.\n\nTo be clear. You don't have to be attracted to me. I still look extremely mannish and probably have a year or more before I start \"passing\". I'm also not saying that you have to get over it if a trans woman has a penis. The intent of my answer was to clarify that if a woman has all of the bodily features of a woman including breasts and vagina and you reject her upon realizing she is trans then you are being transphobic. \n\nHell, I'm relatively liberal as a trans woman, I think that it isn't transphobic if you are attracted to a woman but lose interest because she still has a penis. That is an *extremely* rare position that gets me in a lot of trouble in trans support groups.\n\nAlso, I \"feel\" about my gender identity in the same way that you \"feel\" the sky is blue.

Your past characteristics are perfectly acceptable criteria for attraction and willingness to date (and that goes for *any* past characteristics) Shaming somebody for that by calling them a transphobe is 100% wrong and the same damn thing as somebody shaming you for your gender identity. \n\nIf somebody said \"I'm not dating you because I consider you a man\" it would hurtful and assholeish, and totally unnecessary.

They are closed on weekends, and even on weekdays, they are only open from about 9am-5pm. You have to pay to mail anything, and yet the post office still operates on a deficit, and they have to use tax money to stay afloat. And for a long time, they were the only place you could go to mail things. And it was expensive (even tho they operated at a loss). And even with planes and cars it took a week to mail a letter to the next county.\n\nFedex, UPS, DHL, etc. offer the exact same services as the post office. They are open til 9pm, and open on weekends. They make weekend deliveries. They make overnight deliveries, and 2-day deliveries for cheaper than the post office could do in 2 weeks. The post office does this NOW, but they didn't have that service until well after private carriers invented it. After Fedex came along, the post office has had to drastically reduce prices in order to compete, which means it costs even more tax dollars to keep the post office running, because they operate at an even bigger loss than before. The only reason the post office even stays open anymore is because they are required to by law. But we are literally just wasting money, because we have at least 4 or 5 other companies that can do the exact same thing for cheaper. And guess what? Not only does Fedex, etc. make a profit, they PAY taxes, rather than take them. So it would be much better for everyone if we took all the business the post office does, give it to Fedex, who will pay taxes on each delivery, rather than use tax money on each delivery.\n\nSo why again should I want drugs developed by the government?",

Legitimate point. \n\nEmoluments clause \u2014 There isn\u2019t a case here. The Trump administration writes a check every year to the United States Treasury for profits it identifies as coming from foreign governments. When/if these cases ever come to trial, while in George Washington wrote letters to diplomats asking they wished to rent one of his properties when they were in the States. This implies that normal business profits weren\u2019t considered emoluments back in the day. My unprofessional opinion is the courts will agree. \n\nThe Epstein claim is just mud slinging. They travelled in the same circles, which included some parties, but there was no significant relationship. The lawyer for one of the women who sued Epstein claims that Trump was eager to help in the case and didn\u2019t require a subpoena. Plus, Trump booted Epstein from Mara Logo because of his behavior with young females. \n\nAsserting foreign power for political gain \u2014 I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic on this one except that this has been ignored as an impeachable offense. Biden did withhold a billion dollar aid package until a country\u2019s lead prosecutor was fired \u2014 a prosecutor pursuing a case against the company that Biden\u2019s son was a board member. Kennedy asked Russian help in the 1984 election and numerous politicians have made requests of other government to act or not act because it would impact politics. If you add that one to Trump\u2019s ledger, there are a lot of other presidents who should have similar charges added to their ledgers as well. \n\nCover up \u2014 I presume this is because the call transcript was put on a more secure server? I can\u2019t blame him after his early calls were leaked to the press, negatively impacting diplomacy.  Also, other presidents have done the same. I don\u2019t believe this rises to impeachment level. \n\nAnd as others have mentioned, many presidents have been guilty of impeachable offenses but were not impeached. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus. Roosevelt locked you 100,000 people solely because of their ethnic heritage. Jackson and the trail of tears. Andrew Johnson and black civil liberties. Woodrow Wilson has a long list of civil rights violations including segregating government offices. Coolidge conscripted blacks to work under horrible conditions. Etc. Etc. \n\nTrump has his issues, but he is far from the most impeachable by today\u2019s standards.",

Because the latter 3 are [anti-American Imperialism](https://i.imgur.com/BrPgUYe.jpg) while HK and China are convenient pro-Imperialism pro-Trump issues. It's propaganda. \n\n2) While the single death in HK is terrible, police in Dallas just gangland executed a witness that sent a pig behind bars for murdering another person in their own home. Notice how there isn't coverage of the outrage? Do you recall the flurry of fear and demands for justice after Jean's murder? HK is propaganda. \n\n3) America is committing genocide and running concentration camps *right now*. The President is being fucking Impeached *right now*. The Kurds are being genocided by Turkey with permission from America *right now*. All of these issues are ones the 'reddit' liberals could be doing something about. There is *absolutely nothing* you can do to effect HK. It's propaganda. \n\n4) So whether people are angry that you have selective outrage for international events that seems to only come up when it's beneficial to your Corporate interest. Or if it's because you ignore the white supremacist police state. Or if it's because you ignore your genocidal, rearing fascist State.

The external parts of biological sex can almost be completely removed through hormone therapy and surgery, there are many trans people that pass after all. And the internal parts, like DNA, have no bearing on anyone whatsoever.\n\n&gt;it\u2019s not feasible to completely separate them from their biological gender.\n\nMaybe not in every context, but for the vast majority of interactions it is feasible, consider all the trans people you have known, has the fact that they used to be the opposite gender have any impact on how you treated or interacted with them? Should it have? Why?\n\n&gt;I can\u2019t help but feel that there are some things that people need to defer to their biological gender for\n\nSo you mention sports and locker rooms/bathrooms, I'll start with the latter. Trans people that pass exist, enforcing biological gender segregation in bathrooms etc forces bearded butch guys to go into women's bathrooms, and ultra feminine women into men's bathrooms. \n\nAs for sports it's a difficult one. There are plenty of advantages that we allow into sports, such as genetics, socio-economic backgrounds, differing funding for training facilities etc. We all seem to agree that the advantages given by these don't need any segregation or leveling of the playing field. So the question we need to be asking when it comes to trans athletes is not do they get an advantage, its whether they get an advantage significantly larger than what might be given by other factors. I have heard that the requirements for a trans woman to compete in many competitive sports (usually a certain amount of time taking certain hormones) often eliminates any advantages that men have over women, such as increased bone density and strength. It is almost never the case that one can simply call themselves female and start competing against women. \n\n&gt;it seems much more bold for someone to acknowledge their biological gender but still adamantly claim their right to express themselves and their identity however they choose.\n\nAs bold as it may be, its probably not what trans people want. If you were trapped in the wrong body, and went through a bunch of corrective procedures so that no one could tell you were trans, and you felt like you finally had your body, would you want to have to proclaim to everyone that you were actually a man/woman? From what I've gathered most trans people want acceptance and to be able to live their lives, and that's what we should be aiming for.",

So I let the corporation pay for things I need. I own it, I can make it do whatever I want. But the corporation has to pay massive taxes on the profits it earns. Instead of paying taxes, I form another company in Ireland (not the only country, just a decent example), where taxes on corporate profits are minimal. This company owns all the patents to the corp. Then, any profits that the US corporation makes are paid as \u201cexpenses\u201d to the company in Ireland for the right to use the patents, designs, and copyrights. No profits in the US.\n\nEdit: Many people are pointing out how the owner would still owe taxes in the above scenario, and I agree, they would still owe taxes. The question is whether they would owe the wealth tax as outlined by Bernie and Warren. I misspoke earlier by referring to my hypothetical person as the owner. Once the company incorporates, the shareholders own the company, of which the original owner might be a member. The idea is that, while they aren\u2019t the owner, they might continue to hold a position of power, either on the board or as CEO, that affords them a large degree of control over the company. Assets owned by the company, and the company itself, are not owned by the previous owner anymore, so they wouldn\u2019t contribute to their household wealth. Bernie, at least, intends to use the IRS\u2019s calculation of estate wealth for his appraisals, which roughly calculates assets less liabilities. The former owner will still have an income, but they won\u2019t have assets to be taxed under these wealth tax programs. I hope this clears things up.",

Culturally, the disparities in treatment of men and women (just like white and non-white ppl) is based on a power dynamic, and in almost all areas, in levels of increasing subtlety, men are deemed as the primary gender, and women are \u2018other\u2019 to that. Because of this, saying \u2018we need to look at men\u2019s issues as much as women\u2019s\u2019 is an oxymoron: men\u2019s issues have always been primary, prioritised, addressed, and women\u2019s issues (I.e. how the hell do women still get paid less than men in 2020?) are unresolved, albeit changing for the better, very slowly. Because men have power in comparison to women there are fewer issues affecting men worse than women. Period poverty is something women face BECAUSE they are women, as is the sheer amount of sexual misconduct and rape they face in a highly objectivized patriarchy, women are also paid less than men because they are women, and in comparison to these big sweeping structural inequalities that women face, men don\u2019t have hardly any.

Such things as male depression, suicides, the likelihood of being physically assaulted or killed, the fact that there's literally ONE men's shelter in the entire western hemisphere. The fact that men are the subject of domestic abuse almost as much as women, the fact that women caregivers are more likely to abuse male children, munchausen by proxy is a primarily female phenomenon that affects primarily boys. The fact that men almost never get the same type of emotional reinforcement that girls and women get...\n\nYou get my point, I trust.

I think women are going to keep suffering until they recognize that most of the extant social issues aren't gendered, and the ones that are need to be addressed in equal measure.

A false accusation is usually extremely expensive (on the accuser's part) even if they get away with it, they will be vilified by their friends, the media if it goes public, etc. There's no financial incentive, and it's unlikely that the accused will even get convicted.\n\n&gt; Are you saying that there should be a different legal standard in sexual assault/ rape cases? Ie. guilty until proven innocent?\n\nNo. This is a common misunderstanding with regards to \"innocent until proven guilty\". That term in particular has been massively misused. It is literally not true that someone is \"innocent until proven guilty\": someone is innocent **until they commit a crime**. The \"innocent until proven guilty\" is a term that should be really preceded with \"**criminal courts should act as if defendendants are** innocent until proven guilty\", lest they violate their basic rights. In reality, of course, if you see someone steal your stuff, you don't have to wait until their convicted in court to go around telling people they stole your stuff. But when it comes to sexual assault, people tend to act as if you do.\n\nSo that's the main thrust of the slogan.

In this regard I think it\u2019s no coincidence that we almost never hear about sexual assault of men by women or of people in higher positions of power by people in lower positions of power. Because of this there is certainly a motive for people to claim sexual assault, whether real or fabricated. \n\nIn regards to \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d you make some interesting points but I think there is a gray area there. If someone claims a theft, but their claim can\u2019t be supported by direct or circumstantial evidence, is it really fair for the purported victim to go around saying they were robbed? Isn\u2019t a major function of the courts is to sort out what claims should be taken seriously, and which cases must be dismissed?

Any time I see a woman accusing a man in the \"court of public opinion\" she gets fucking _shredded_ in the media. It's brutal. Like, take Kavanaugh: his accuser had her entire life history dredged up and scrutinised by people in conservative media. It's bizarre to me that people think she went through all of that just to keep a republican off the court. (conservatives also bring it up often as an example of someone being \"unfairly charged in the court of public opinion\", which I think is also bizarre. Like, _he won_. He got away with it. He's on the fucking supreme court, he's one of the most powerful guys in the world. The \"court of public opinion\" did _nothing_ to him).\n\n&gt; If someone claims a theft, but their claim can\u2019t be supported by direct or circumstantial evidence, is it really fair for the purported victim to go around saying they were robbed?\n\nWhat? Yes? If someone commits a crime against me and I know they did it I'm going to tell anyone who wants to hear it. Why would I wait for a court ruling? The purpose of *criminal court* is to punish crime, not to \"sort out claims\".

            "text": "&gt; The issue centered around criminalizing marijuana in the first place contains racist origins, as one of the main topics of discussion centered around the legalization of marijuana pertains to the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans and other minority ethnic groups. About a century ago, hemp fibers were integrated into everyday life such as clothes, ropes and paper. Business Insider said that a propaganda film portrayed marijuana in a negative light, whereas the media portrayed it as a gateway drug around the 1930\u2019s. Later, it was connected as a violence stimulant for African American and Hispanic people, which aided it in being criminalized. This led to African American &amp; Hispanic individuals to be arrested more than whites, a statistic that is still prevalent in today\u2019s time.\n\nNone of this actually supports your central argument. It's basically a strawman, considering almost none of these things are central to the reasons marijuana is criminalized in many places today. I have not seen any proof that minorities are unfairly discriminated against in regards to marijuana possession - just because they are arrested at a higher rate for it does not prove discrimination.\n\n&gt; Legalizing marijuana and taxing it like alcohol can have a major benefit on the US economy. States such as Colorado have over 3,000 businesses in their state and has generated over $6.5 billion. According to the Colorado Sun, their marijuana tax cash fund that Colorado receives must be used for health care, health education, substance abuse prevention programs and law enforcement.\n\nThis is completely unrelated to the argument, so you don't have to answer this, but I would like to ask you a rhetorical question: What are your thoughts on Trump's proposal that we all go back to work amid COVID-19 for the sake of saving the economy?\n\n&gt; If we are to adopt the federal legalization of marijuana, we can have the opportunity to combat both racial discrimination and incarceration of minority individuals and increase federal revenue that we can use for national programs to benefit education, homelessness, and free programs for communities.\n\nI am not convinced that there is any true discrimination at play. I will agree with you that it could increase government revenue, however, this point alone is not nearly strong enough to be an argument for legalization, because there are literally hundreds of different things the government could do to increase its revenue, many of which I believe would be preferable to marijuana legalization.\n\nI believe the best way to illustrate why cannabis is not a universally positive thing is by telling you about my own experience.\n\nI used to be a very heavy cannabis user. I would roll my own joints and buy weed by the quarter pound. I would smoke pretty much every day, and on occasion multiple times per day, almost always with my friends.\n\nToday, I have not smoked cannabis in four months, after having gradually dialed back the rate at which I was smoking. I've seen enormous benefits in my life since, such as higher grades, a better social life, and a more fulfilling romantic relationship. Why is this?\n\nUltimately, while marijuana can be enjoyable for a user for the short time after they smoke, it has zero proven benefits in the long run and has many detriments. It is a fact that it is terrible for your memory - anyone who has ever gotten reasonably high can attest to this. There would be times where I would have incredibly long conversations with a friend, and would forget the words that I had said five seconds prior, which would result in the conversation ending because we both had no idea what we were talking about. The next day, I would forget most of what I experienced during the time I was high, and would be a bit sluggish for the first few hours of the day, which usually resulted in the entire rest of the day being wasted on idle tasks. I am not sure whether cannabis has notable harmful effects on your long term memory, although I suspect that it does. If you consume it every day, it certainly will, because those small fragments of your memory that are lost will add up with time.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether cannabis is a harmful drug comes down to your worldview. What do you think the point of life is? Would you rather live as a docile, sedated being, without true awareness of your surroundings or any power to change them, or live as a lucid man, with the ability to experience difficulty and have it shape you into a better person? If you choose the former, that is fine, but you should be aware of what you are picking.\n\nIf you have ever read the novel *Brave New World* (if you haven't - go read it now), I find myself sympathizing with John.

That's not because of some problems the anime community have caused, but because most anime convey themes, settings, character designs, and plot elements which are generally looked down upon in western society.\n\nShows which piece that veil typically avoid those tropes. My Hero Academia is about as western as you can get for battle shounen. Attack on Titan benefited from airing around the time Game of Thrones was taking off and also featured the \"anyone can die at anytime\" tension GoT made famous.\n\n&gt; And I'd love to recommend shows like Evangelion, Beastars, cowboy Beebop, fullmeatl alchemist: Brotherhood, JoJo's etc. But I know that I will get the weird looks from them.\n\nI can't speak to most of these, but do you *really* think a normie is going to watch a show about a wolf trying to parse out his sexual desires for a bunny?

There is simply no military victory available against those numbers (in a place where those numbers can be brought to bear) that doesn't involve a cataclysmic war, that makes the two world wars look like a minor skirmish.\n\nThat doesn't mean there can't be consequences. We could retaliate by fully recognizing Taiwanese independence for instance. While we can't do anything about Hong Kong due to it being so close to the mainland, Taiwan is another story entirely. 100 miles of ocean changes the dynamic, its no longer about the total number of people that can be mustered, by about how many, if any, you can safely transport over the straight. The world wouldn't need to go on the offensive, but could sit back and defend. \n\nToday, China may be able to invade Taiwan without intervention, but even then, victory is far from certain given the massive challenges faced by the side trying to conduct such a long range landing operation. Today, with US intervention, and even more so with US &amp; Allies, a Chinese invasion would be absolutely crushed so badly it would be one of the biggest military disasters in history.

I happen to broadly agree with this approach, but it's important to understand that it is a very specific lens through which to examine the world.\n\nCritics of neo-realism observe that it is amoral at best, and immoral at worst.  Some critics of neo-realism are influential people, in some circle or another.  My favorite example of such a person is Noam Chomsky, an avowed anti-neo-realist.  Noam Chomsky certainly doesn't approve of this message, and thinks that things ought to be done about totalitarianism.  He rejects the idea that individual morality does not apply to nation states.\n\nThen there is the lens of American politics to consider.  Americans broadly approve of Democracy, and broadly disapprove of Autocracy.  To the extent that a 'typical' American has an opinion about China, they probably disapprove of them...as they are more autocratic and less democratic.  Accordingly, a \"tough stance\" on China by political aspirants will likely resonate with American voters.  Sanctions may be a way to \"be tough\" even if they don't produce the result of changing China.\n\nViewed through the neo-realistic lens you are using, it is certainly the case that China's behavior can be modeled as aggressively pursuing sovereignty over a spread of territory that it deems to be 'inherently Chinese' or 'within the Chinese cultural sphere.'  This explains their invasion and occupation of Tibet, their strife with Uigher separatists, their stance toward Hong Kong and Macau, and ultimately underlies why they will probably never back down on Taiwan and simply accept it if the world community would recognize them as a separate country.

When they see George Floyd- it is a reminder of their collective life experience of shit treatment at the hands of cops, prosecutors, judges and juries.\n\nhttps://static.prisonpolicy.org/scans/ccj/LowLevelOffenseStudyFinal11.09.04.pdf\n\nBlacks are 700% more likely to be exonerated by the Innocence Project (and others) for murder. (But only murder / death penalty exonerations are even pursued- so the vast majority of crimes never get this review).\n\nAlso:\n\n-50% more likely to be stopped for \u201cno reason\u201d while driving\n\n-250% more likely to be searched without consent (whites 30% more likely to have contraband)\n\n-50% more likely to be arrested vs warned\n\n-15% more likely to be offered a plea deal with prison time (vs community service time served etc)\n\n-20% more likely to be convicted\n\n-serve 10% longer sentences. \n\nAll studies behind these #\u2019s control for what you\u2019d expect- geography income priors circumstances of arrest specific charges etc.\n\nFun fact- if you multiply out all those factors from stopped on the street to convicted, it ends up being roughly 675% (1.5 * 2.5 * 1.5 * 1.2) more likely that a random black person (vs white person) goes from legally driving their car to prison. Eerily close to that 700% more likely to be exonerated.\n\nHere\u2019s one on driving stops and searches from Minnesota:\n\nhttps://www.twincities.com/2016/07/08/data-dive-racial-disparities-in-minnesota-traffic-stops/\n\nNumbers are higher than what I quoted.\n\nAnother from Vermont:\n\nhttp://digital.vpr.net/post/study-spotlights-dangers-driving-while-black-and-brown-vermont#stream/0\n\nAgain, numbers higher than what I quoted. Both of these are localizing and control for obvious factors (geo, reason for stop, etc).\n\nBoth cover- stops, searches, and contraband found.\n\n\nI wrote this a while back saving the stats from this WaPo study:\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/\n\nIn which the stats are in line with my claims- rather than much worse, as in those two studies.\n\nOn arrests:\n\nhttps://www.twincities.com/2016/07/13/st-anthony-police-data-shows-disproportionate-arrests-of-blacks/\n\nAgain, data is worse than what I claimed. Whites are roughly 3.5x as likely to be let off with a warning vs arrested. Data I was using was more conservative. Here\u2019s another study in line with the data I posted:\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00230.x\n\nPlea deals:\n\nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/247227.pdf\n\n\n\nOn convictions, here you go:\n\nhttp://www.apa.org/monitor/mar01/jurorbias.aspx\n\nhttps://deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-racial-bias-among-jurors-death-penalty-cases\n\nOnce again- numbers are even worse than what I claimed.\n\nHere\u2019s another fun one- white victims made the defendant 2x more likely to be convicted, vs minority victims. Let criminals go free! As long as the victims were black.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615300642\n\n\nHere\u2019s the original sentencing study I was referencing:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/\n\nOn sentencing- Florida is among the worst. Depending on county and crime, blacks getting anywhere from 1.1x to 2.2x the sentence- same crime priors and circumstances. This is *after* the Florida legislature passed a points system to be used by judges in sentencing- to fight racial disparity. Judges are basically ignoring it.\n\nhttp://projects.heraldtribune.com/bias/sentencing/\n\nAnd finally, exoneration:\n\nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf\n\nBlacks 7x more likely to be wrongfully convicted/ exonerated for murder.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nWhat\u2019s fun, is that Before the current justice system was formed... we had Jim Crow.

Or are they going to attack this data later on in the study?\n\n&gt;Differential treatment between Whites and African Americans was found in a New York study of misdemeanor offenses (1996).

The study also reports that \u201cfrom 1990-1992, one out of every three minority defendants given time in local jails \u2013 where sentences of less than a year are served \u2013 would have received a more lenient sentences if they had been White\u201d2 . In contrast, a statistical analysis conducted by the Monroe County NAACP branch on sentence length for misdemeanor crimes found that African Americans had shorter sentences than Whites when it came to misdemeanors; \u201cAfrican Americans got an average of 9 days and Whites an average of 23 days.\u201d They also found a \u201csignificantly greater number of zero day sentences for African Americans than Whites who were charged with misdemeanors\u201d3 . Lastly, they found that African Americans and Whites were charged at about the same rate when it came to misdemeanors.\n\nAnd sorry just one other thing, I was looking at your second study about rate of stops while driving, you mentioned there was a group that was pulled over for no reason? Is that true? I was under the impression that police legally have to have a reason to pull you over. They have to give *some* reason, right? Is the implication that the police make up a reason or?\n\nI'm looking over the rest but that damn post hoc fallacy is coming up again. I appreciate the data they've gathered, but how do we know it's specifically racism that is causing these disparities? I can see the argument based on this data of \"Black drivers are stopped more, but they also had contraband less\". But couldn't the explanation just be that black drivers were stopped more often, presumably for a justified reason, and they just didn't have contraband more often?

This is the same for men and their mothers.**\n\nThe opposite can also happen due to a bad relationship with a parent, we strive for the opposite to account for failure.\n\nI'm sure you've heard the term \"daddy issues\"\n\n\nThe result of this (as well as culture and religion) means we often date within our races\n\n\n**Edit. I'm discussing straight here because I'm not sure what is most common for gay and lesbian, I think an added complication there would be that an unfortunately large amount of people are not treated equally when they come out and that would affect the parental relationship and therefore the person's choice in partner.",

Because police brutality affects all races, and when I a white man see people say black lives matter and hear them talk like somehow it\u2019s my fault. I have to say something to protest both the police brutality and the gross demonization of white men. When I hear people I thought were friends say I\u2019m privileged and part of the problem. Even though they know damn well they had better upbringings, more money, and more opportunities, it puts some fire in me. Plus we both know if George Floyd was white nobody would have given a shit. And if someone decided to protest by saying white lives matter they would have been labeled a neo-nazi, even though many more white people are killed by police than blacks.\n\nThere is a huge divide between white and black culture in America. And if white men In particular aren\u2019t willing to suck the dick of the black community they racist nazis. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m willing to stand for, I will stand for all lives and equality of opportunity for all people. All the progress we have made towards that is blatantly ignored. Over the last 20 years police shootings have dropped quite a bit especially when comes to blacks. Black people have more opportunities than ever. And that brings me back to my poor black \u201cfriend\u201d who thinks I\u2019m privileged. I scored higher on every part of the ACT than him, was a much better student in high school while he barely graduated. Yet when we both applied to the same school for the same major, he gets accepted and a scholarship, and I get declined. So yeah I think blacks need to stop using the victim mentality and realize that 99.99999% of white people don\u2019t care that your black and could even be your friend.

I agree and I cringe whenever I see it, and it should absolutely never be flown above a public building. But I'll presume you're talking about someone's private property. \n\nFirst, we need to think about why so many southerners fly old dixie. I don't know how familiar you are with Lost Cause mythology, but essentially it's a psuedohistory pushed after the Civil War arguing that the causus belii for the Civil War wasn't slavery, rather it was some amorphous idea of states rights combined with cultural differences that led to the clash. \n\nSo let's say you tell a proud southerner \"that flag is just like the nazi flag.\" They will get defensive and entrench. For them, it's a flag about heritage and place, which is often flown from a place of insecurity do to the economic status of most parts of the south. They might even have relatives who fought against the nazis in WWII. No learning has happened, and all you've done is widen a cultural division that's already wide enough. They'll think you're ignorant, you will the think the same of them. \n\nBecause when you compare someone to a nazi, you're saying they are irredeemable. There are no educational excuses for being naive about a nazi flag- everyone knows it represents pure evil, full stop. \n\nI know plenty of southerners who have southern pride. Many are ignorant, some of them racist, but most of them are *insecure*. They see a country that has left them and their way of life behind and they cling to any sign that they are still relevant and have a point of pride- for whatever reason, they find that in the Lost Cause. \n\nEducate them. Point them to the founding documents of the seceding states in 1861 and how often they mention slavery as the cause of the rebellion. More importantly, show them that they have other things to be proud about. The South's hospitality, its work ethic, its sense of community and continuity of time. \n\nWe should ditch the rebel flag, for so many reasons.

Further, our findings demonstrate that the Black/ape association predicted actual racial disparities in police violence toward children.\"\n\n[Teachers More Likely to Label Black Students as Troublemakers](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/teachers-more-likely-to-label-black-students-as-troublemakers.html)  \n\"Across both studies, the researchers found that racial stereotypes shaped teachers\u2019 responses not after the first infraction but rather after the second. Teachers felt more troubled by a second infraction they believed was committed by a black student rather than by a white student.  \nIn fact, the stereotype of black students as \u201ctroublemakers\u201d led teachers to want to discipline black students more harshly than white students after two infractions, Eberhardt and Okonofua said. They were more likely to see the misbehavior as part of a pattern, and to imagine themselves suspending that student in the future.\"\n\n[Stereotyping across intersections of race and age: Racial stereotyping among White adults working with children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201696)  \n\u201cParticipants were 1022 White adults who volunteer and/or work with children in the United States who completed a cross-sectional, online survey. Results indicate high proportions of adults who work or volunteer with children endorsed negative stereotypes towards Blacks and other ethnic minorities. Respondents were most likely to endorse negative stereotypes towards Blacks, and least likely towards Asians (relative to Whites). Moreover, endorsement of negative stereotypes by race was moderated by target age. Stereotypes were often lower towards young children but higher towards teens.\u201d\n\n[Examining racial/ethnic disparities in school discipline in the context of student-reported behavior infractions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740918311095)  \n\u201cEngagement in particular behaviors had differential impact for African American vs. White students on the odds of receiving behavioral warnings, with African American students being less likely to be warned than their White peers. The current study demonstrates both the presence of disproportionality in non-exclusionary discipline as well as evidence that African American students experience escalated consequences (e.g., lower likelihood of receiving a warning) for infractions when they also engage in certain behaviors, even if those behaviors are not the direct cause for discipline.\u201d\n\n[Black Students Face More Discipline, Data Suggests](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/education/black-students-face-more-harsh-discipline-data-shows.html)  \n\"Although black students made up only 18 percent of those enrolled in the schools sampled, they accounted for 35 percent of those suspended once, 46 percent of those suspended more than once and 39 percent of all expulsions, according to the Civil Rights Data Collection\u2019s 2009-10 statistics from 72,000 schools in 7,000 districts, serving about 85 percent of the nation\u2019s students. The data covered students from kindergarten age through high school.\"  \n\"Black and Hispanic students \u2014 particularly those with disabilities \u2014 are also disproportionately subject to seclusion or restraints. .... Black students with disabilities constituted 21 percent of the total, but 44 percent of those with disabilities subject to mechanical restraints, like being strapped down. And while Hispanics made up 21 percent of the students without disabilities, they accounted for 42 percent of those without disabilities who were placed in seclusion.\"\n\n[Breaking School\u2019s Rules: A Statewide Study of How School Discipline Relates to Students\u2019 Success and Juvenile Justice Involvement](https://csgjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Breaking_Schools_Rules_Report_Final.pdf)  \n\u201cMultivariate analyses, which enabled researchers to control for 83 different variables in isolating the effect of race alone on disciplinary actions, found that African-American students had a 31 percent higher likelihood of a school discretionary action, compared to otherwise identical white and Hispanic students.\u201d\n\n[Racial disparities in school discipline are growing, federal data show](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/racial-disparities-in-school-discipline-are-growing-federal-data-shows/2018/04/24/67b5d2b8-47e4-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.6559bc0b2f34)  \n\"Black students accounted for 15 percent of the student body in the 2015-2016 school year but 31 percent of arrests. Two years earlier, black students accounted for 16 percent of the student body and 27 percent of arrests. The data also show students with disabilities are far more likely to face suspension or arrests at school. They accounted for 12 percent of enrollment but 28 percent of all arrests and referrals to law enforcement.  \nA report from the Government Accountability Office released this month had similar findings, concluding that black students, boys and students with disabilities were overrepresented in disciplinary action: \u201cThese disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended,\u201d the GAO report said.\"\n\n[Black teens who commit a few crimes go to jail as often as white teens who commit dozens](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/30/black-teens-who-commit-a-few-crimes-go-to-jail-as-often-as-white-teens-who-commit-dozens/?utm_term=.fa43b9a1be29)  \n\"Although there were negligible differences among the racial groups in how frequently boys committed crimes, white boys were less likely to spend time in a facility than black and Hispanic boys who said they'd committed crimes just as frequently, as shown in the chart above.

Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.\"  \n\u201cFor poor children, the pattern is reversed.

Adoption of pro-testing legislation increases black employment in the testing sector by 7-30% and relative wages by 1.4-13.0%, with the largest shifts among low skilled black men. Results further suggest that employers substitute white women for blacks in the absence of testing.\u201d\n\n[Minorities Who 'Whiten' Resumes Get More Job Interviews](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2017/05/17/minorities-who-whiten-resumes-get-more-job-interviews/#6f8a07c37b74)  \n\"Employer callbacks for resumes that were whitened fared much better in the application pile than those that included ethnic information, even though the qualifications listed were identical. Twenty-five percent of black candidates received callbacks from their whitened resumes, while only 10% got calls when they left ethnic details intact.\"  \n\"Employers claiming to be pro-diversity discriminated against resumes with racial references just as much as employers who didn\u2019t mention diversity at all in their job ads.\"\n\n[Race at Work: Realities of Race and Criminal Record in the NYC Job Market](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/pager/files/race_at_work.pdf)  \n\"As we can see in Figure 1, the proportion of positive responses depends strongly on the race of the job applicant. This comparison demonstrates a strong racial hierarchy, with whites in the lead, followed by Latinos, with blacks trailing far behind. These outcomes suggest that blacks are only slightly more than half as likely to receive consideration by employers relative to equally qualified white applicants. Latinos also pay a penalty for minority status, but they are clearly preferred relative to their black counterparts.\"  \n\"[T]his white applicant with a felony conviction appears to do just as well, if not better, than his black counterpart with no criminal background.

            "text": "To start since your first thing was a question. Racism is not trivial. The amount of such racism in 2020 is trivial.\n\nThis next part kinda long, and I felt this necessary considering I\u2019m an outlier to the white privilege myth. I became disabled at age 22. I had a medical malpractice lawsuit that wouldn\u2019t continue to a trial because among other things, not being a part of a minority group would hurt my odds of winning in the area the trial would take place. My father, was disbarred to make a lesson out of people who might commit welfare fraud though he was innocent. My father received court mandated community service and had to write letters of apology to families who were rich in the community for pulling a legally carried unloaded gun on kids who broke into one of our vehicles then slammed their car into my uncles with him in it almost killing them, to get them to stop and wait for the cops to arrive. My father was beaten by a police officer in an Albertsons, while all surveillance footage not only magically vanished after, but, was basically told that it was his fault anyways. No one has ever come to my fathers aid and he has experienced more than most people will or are willing to admit, and he was a white male. Served in the military (and some of the records made public now has done things that deserve someone\u2019s respect somewhere, but won\u2019t). Had the ideal wife. Had 8 children. Payed back all his student loans. I also am part of a religious group that in the recorded history of the US has had an actual government order of extermination signed.\n\nI felt this is important to note, because, this isn\u2019t just my family. There is a fundamental flaw with not only racism being prevalent in 2020, but the gross overlooking of horrible things happening to more than just one specific group of people. Can I have my white privilege yet?\n\nNow onto the provided links and your google doc. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason. Many are just facts. Facts that piss off people, but facts nonetheless. A statistic saying X thing shouldn\u2019t be surprising when it supports a stereotype. Asking people to remove this thought process is just gross on the person requesting this. It can also drastically lead to unsafe practices. There is a strong difference though between stereotypical data being used in a manner that is correct, and in a manner that shows disdain. I believe that a lot of this is also on the receiving end of the stereotype. Sometimes it makes life easier to assume that not everyone is out to get you, and to maybe thing that sometimes people say things in a way they don\u2019t mean. Anyways, rambling on this part. I think you get the idea.\n\nI found a common tie between a lot of your links you share as a basis to what is the overall problem and a lot of these studies are based off perception and not practice. For example, in the current climate I could ask 100 people of how they view cops are acting towards African Americans. Let\u2019s say 89% of them give the exact view. The study would be published as \u201cthe growing epidemic of cop vs African American violence.\u201d Then this study would be used. However, factual FBI data would argue otherwise.\n\nYour first link was hard to really use for any credibility. Not only using outdated quotes of perceived views, it makes assumptions off of these queues(IE. the way an African American may have been referred to in 1999. It\u2019s now 2020). But to make matters worse, and will be the main issue with your first link since it\u2019s what is the basis of the article, children. There is too many variables that were left open for me to believe any of that data and why it\u2019s so important people actually look at data. The mean age of the data was 19 year olds from a non mentioned large public university with no other tracked factors. I unfortunately didn\u2019t continue much after that because I don\u2019t necessarily care to not only read inaccurate info, but, further thoughts on the inaccurate info.\n\nSecond link. I\u2019m having a hard time finding any supplemental data on this. Idk if outdated it\u2019s not there or doesn\u2019t exist or just user error. All I readily see available is the amount of participants their sex and their race.\n\nThird link just refers to standard stereotypical views, although unfortunate, had a basis of reality. You can\u2019t argue against this if you are going to present data and use numbers. It\u2019s illogical so do so.\n\nSkipped around a few just to try and ignore the common trend I don\u2019t think I need to comment on every link provided.\n\nSome of these links should be self evident though and not need a study. More rich white people than more rich black people not only makes logical sense when not doing per capita analysis, but the fact that slavery did exist would just that continuing to live in a poverty state would not only make descendants more likely to be in that state, but, to have to work harder for gain. This isn\u2019t an indication of current racism.\n\nI think one of the only things out of all these links that I skimmed through that had credible statistical data for me to step back and be like woah to was the increased likelihood or longer incarcerations if white. However, there is a fundamental issue on these studies and this is breaking the law to begin with.\n\nTbh there is just to many outliers in a lot of what you linked to really be some kinds of counterpoint  towards the OP. Much of it is either outdated info or referencing periods of times long gone as a basis for current validation of white man privilege. Thus, the entirety of the OP existing to begin with, there is no argument that racism has existed.",

            "text": "There is some evidence and third person accounts which say that Kanye West was never actually a Trump supporter, but instead faked his support in order to meet with Trump and help free some wrongly imprisoned POC. I link an article which includes a quote from GLC (a rapper signed to kanyes label) that \"claims that Kanye has gotten rid of all his MAGA hats &amp; was reportedly just wearing them to get innocent people out of jail. GLC also recalled West as saying, \u201cBro, I\u2019m just telling\u2019 you that we got that amazing woman out of jail in Florida, right?\u2026\u201d We didn\u2019t really get to have that meeting until I put the hat on. So he lookin\u2019 at like it as, more so, \u2018OK, I wear the hat, I get the stones thrown at me, I\u2019ll have people hating me, but people gonna get free.'\u201d \n\nHe also claims that Kanye gave him all of his MAGA hats, saying he'll never wear them again, to throw away. Additionally, if you check who he donated to in 2016, you'll see that it was not Trump, but actually Hillary.\n\nRecall back to 2016 when Kanye first announced he was running for president. He actually said that he would run in 2020 (Kanye 2020 was a meme that year). After he became a public Trump supporter, he changed it to \"Kanye 2024\", showing support for Trump's reelection in 2020.\n\nNow that he has announced his 2020 campaign, Kanye is effectively renouncing his support for Trump. If he was truly a Trump supporter, I do not believe he would run for president until 2024.\n\nBefore I get into it, I would like to say this. I believe Kanye still has a path to the presidency, despite the late announcement. I'll explain. With this introduction out of the way, let's address your main points:\n\n1) Kanye West cannot truly believe he has a chance of winning? I think quite the opposite. I believe Kanye thinks he is the answer to America. These last few months have not been kind to Trump, obviously, and perhaps during this span he decided he did not want to support Trump. I have been a fan of Kanye for years now, and from what I've seen, I think he seriously believes he will win the election. If there's anything Kanye lacks, it definitely is not confidence, and there is definitely a chance that he wins it, even if it is 1 in a million.\n\n2) This is a great point, but again, a lot has changed over the last year. I think it is very possible that Kanye has decided that Trump is not the answer, but also sees faults with Biden, so he is perhaps trying to get in the race last second. I do not know enough about our political system to know exactly how this works, but I believe Kanye can still receive write-in votes in these states  He only cannot be on the ballot in 17 states, such as Texas and New York, and these are states that he is likely to lose anyway. Let's also not forget how our elections work: if Kanye ran in 2016 and took just a few states from Trump, he would have forced a contingent election, which is where he would have to appeal to both sides of Congress as a middle ground solution. If Congress cannot agree to vote Biden or Trump in a theoretical contingent election, why would they not choose Kanye? I believe this *can* happen today (but I also don't think it will happen, just speculation).\n\n3) I hit on this previously. Please see links below. The rumor is that Kanye was never a Trump supporter, but instead used Trump to help free wrongly imprisoned POC.\n\nOne more thing: I think a large amount of Americans support Kanye. He is the only presidential candidate right now not accused of sexual assault or pedophilia. How many tweets have you seen that say \"America is really making us choose between Trump and Biden???\" and if Kanye has even the smallest chance of becoming president, it's because of people who strongly feel like they shouldn't vote for Biden or Trump. These people would not vote for Biden anyway, whether Kanye runs or not, so Kanye isn't really taking away from Biden's votes to the benefit of Trump. The only votes that Kanye is taking from is from a group of people who would likely refuse to vote for Biden, despite the alternative being Trump, anyway.\n\nSources:\n\nKanye Support Was Fake: https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/new-report-claims-kanye-west-faked-support-for-donald-trump-to-benefit-black-people.html/\n\nKanye Donated $2700 to Hillary:\nhttps://www.complex.com/music/2016/11/kanye-west-donated-2700-dollars-hillary-clinton-campaign\n\nKanye says 2024, not 2020:\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/11/08/kanye-west-says-hes-running-president-2024/2527854001/",

Some of these National headline killings have the victim acting outrageously under the circumstances, but it\u2019s passed off and twisted into a \u201csummary execution by police.\u201d  It ignores and bastardizes the reality of the job.\n\nAs a quick example, in NY you can\u2019t use a \u201cchokehold\u201d or a knee in the back anymore.  Sounds great.  Tasers only have one shot and are successful less than 50% of the time.  Mace is successful even less.  Using a baton can be considered deadly physically force if you hit someone in the neck or the head.  So you show up to a call where a man is acting violently, let\u2019s say beating his wife.  You have to walk in there alone and handle it (funding), this is your job. Usually, talking works.  Sometimes, talking does not work.  When it doesn\u2019t work.  You can try to handcuff the guy but you can\u2019t headlock him (he can headlock you), if you get him to the ground you cannot use your legs to keep him there (he can use his), you can\u2019t tase in close quarters it doesn\u2019t work, you can\u2019t mace in close quarters because you\u2019ll likely mace yourself too, you can\u2019t use the baton bc if you hit him in the neck or head by accident you\u2019re fired, and if he grabs it from you you\u2019re screwed.  And if he gets the better of you and then grabs one of the 20 knives in every kitchen, you\u2019re dead.\n\nSo, BLM protests which are misguidedly directed at policing practice have had real effects on the average officer\u2019s ability to safely handle situations where innocent people need help.

It's just a convenient way to say that someone isn't transgender, i.e. that their gender identity matches the sex they were born with. Also, you're creating a double standard here. The way you see it, trans people have the right to decide which pronouns people should use to refer to them, but under the condition that cis people should have both the right to decide which pronouns people should use to refer to them (cis people) *and* the right to prohibit other people from calling them *cisgender*. Sure, both are ultimately connected to how you address someone, but you're still giving cis people greater rights.\n\n&gt;People who are trans are trans, people who are not trans don\u2019t need a label equal to identify them as not trans. They are just not trans, the default alignment.\n\nAre you also annoyed by the term *heterosexual*, since that's the \"standard\" and \"normal\" sexual orientation, which, therefore, also shouldn't need a label? How about *able-bodied*? Is that also a bad expression, since people who are not disabled are \"normal\" and don't need a label?\n\n&gt;Stop giving things in the norm names and labels as if to say \u201cthe choice is your trans or cis it matters not\u201d when it does.\n\nThat's not why *cisgender* exists and I think you know that. Literally no one is claiming that you can choose whether you're cis or trans, so the term is not a representation of such a belief.\n\n&gt;MOST people are what you call \u201cCis\u201d what I call normal. And if calling it normal offends trans people, that\u2019s fine.\n\nYou can drop the \"if\" from that second sentence. You know very well that if you call cis people *normal*, that means that trans people are *abnormal*, and that specific term is a term with strong negative connotations that offends people. I've never heard *abnormal* being used as a neutral or positive term when describing someone. Also, like I've implied earlier, why use that term only when talking about gender? Most people are heterosexual. Are non-heterosexuals *abnormal*? Most people are also not disabled. Are disabled people *abnormal*? Also, you can't preach about mutual respect and then imply it's perfectly fine to insult trans people by calling them *abnormal*. And also also, once again, you're trying to establish a double standard: it's fine when you use a negative term to describe trans people, but you have every right to be annoyed when they use *cisgender* to describe you, although that is a term that is not negative in any way.\n\n&gt;Stop defining the norm as equal to the anomaly.\n\nAre you sure *cisgender* does that? It's simply a descriptive term, not a term that states any sort of value judgment.\n\n&gt;Nothing I just said is phobic of anything, if you think it is that\u2019s very much a you problem.\n\nYes, what you've said is transphobic and you're aware of that, which is why you've preemptively tried to label it as not transphobic. If you believe it's just fine to describe a trans person with negative or insulting terms, while you wouldn't dream of describing a cis person the same way, that's transphobic, since it implies that trans people deserve to be treated more poorly or with less respect than cis people just because they're trans. And if you feel offended that I've called one of your ideas transphobic, that's very much a you-problem.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s not a Cis-gendered heteronormative world view, it\u2019s the common view of man.\n\nIt's common because most people are cisgender and heterosexuals. That doesn't mean we shouldn't label it or that it's perfect or that we shouldn't question it or introduce new elements into it or that it is universally embraced or that there are no alternative viewpoints. Also, calling it \"the common view of man\" almost makes it sound like those who don't share it are somehow not a part of human race.\n\n&gt;trying to change the way everyone else sees the world to make space for you is really entitled\n\nOh, you want to talk about entitlement? Isn't it, generally speaking, cishet people, rather than LGBT people, who feel entitled to describe their sexuality and relationships as superior? Aren't cishet people those who have jailed, assaulted, murdered, fired, banned marriage and adoption to and created \"conversion\" programs for those who are sexually not like them due to an unjustified sense of superiority and entitlement?

Is that also a bad expression, since people who are not disabled are \"normal\" and don't need a label? \n\nyup exactly. their are disabled/handicapped people who need assistance and then those that do not. average people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; That's not why *cisgender* exists and I think you know that. \n\nyes i am being a bit hyperbolic to inflate a point I am trying to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; You know very well that if you call cis people *normal*, that means that trans people are *abnormal*, and that specific term is a term with strong negative connotations that offends people. \n\nsorry but i continue not to care. Trans people are a fraction of the population the amount I see society bending over to accommodate these entitled people baffles me, your degree of offence does not matter to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;  I've never heard *abnormal* being used as a neutral or positive term when describing someone. Also, like I've implied earlier, why use that term only when talking about gender? Most people are heterosexual. Are non-heterosexuals *abnormal*? \n\nits used in science all the time. a result you do not expect is abnormal, that's all it means. i don't advocate it only with gender, its just the clearest example of the problem. Straight and Gay has no issue as it arose though common conversation. CIS is a constructed academic term, i don't support constructed academic terms being used in common conversation. its the same problem atheist had with christens over the word \"Theory\" and what it means. in common talk its one in academic its another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;  Also, you can't preach about mutual respect and then imply it's perfectly fine to insult trans people by calling them *abnormal*. \n\nif you think \"abnormal\" is an insult then its no wonder we don't get along, your gage for offence is to sensitive for me to even talk with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; you're trying to establish a double standard: it's fine when you use a negative term to describe trans people, but you have every right to be annoyed when they use *cisgender* to describe you, although that is a term that is not negative in any way. \n\nyes i used your logic against you. It's insane that trans people demand to be called by the pronouns of their choice and assign a label to every one who isn't them with out their consent or input. do I care if people call me CIS? do i get offended? No. it just bugs me. so why do u care if i call you something your not? you don't mind doing it to me.\n\n&gt; Yes, what you've said is transphobic and you're aware of that, which is why you've preemptively tried to label it as not transphobic. \n\ni stand by this to my dying breath. if you took what i said, or said above as a dislike, hatred, or devaluation of trans-people. thats becuase you read it in their. the worst i said was a cold disinterest, and a desire to be left alone by the whole thing. You see opposition in neutrality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;  If you believe it's just fine to describe a trans person with negative or insulting terms, while you wouldn't dream of describing a cis person the same way, that's transphobic, since it implies that trans people deserve to be treated more poorly or with less respect than cis people just because they're trans \n\nif you thing \"abnormal\" is negative and insulting i cant help you. its a descriptor of something that was unexpected. it carries no positive or negative beyond you you prescribe it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; And if you feel offended that I've called one of your ideas transphobic, that's very much a you-problem. \n\nIDGAF what you think honestly. you seem rather closeminded and sure of your self.\n\n&gt; Also, calling it \"the common view of man\" almost makes it sound like those who don't share it are somehow not a part of human race. \n\nno, this is jsut yoru read on it. Mankind has been used to ineitfy the speices for ages. if you see \"the common view of man\" and feel excluded by the statmet, i would ask your self why you feel you are so alien to the majority of your species this stament ameks you feel exlcuded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Isn't it, generally speaking, cishet people, rather than LGBT people, who feel entitled to describe their sexuality and relationships as superior? \n\nsuperior? no. intended? yea. the biological purpose of the species? yes. I've never met any one who thinks cis-hetro sexuality is superior, outside of religious zealots. they might say standard, or default, but neither of those are synonymous with superior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; aren't cishet people those who have jailed, assaulted, murdered, fired, banned marriage and adoption to and created \"conversion\" programs for those who are sexually not like them due to an unjustified sense of superiority and entitlement?  \n\nso if you are going do divide the population between \"cishet\" and LGBT I'm laughing you out of this conversation. you can not attribute to a group the actions of the entire population. i call the LGBT movement entitled because the movement, the institutions , systems and organizations that comprise it make the most egregious demands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nasking to call some one by a pronoun they did not select is not your right. to make taht demand of some one is the most entitled request any rights group has ever made, you are asking to determine the speech i use. regardless of your reasoning this request is egregious and you dont even understand why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou address nothing i said save the comments on gender. i don't think you want to change my view i think you want to defend yours.",

But I think his actions can be explained in a way that puts the emphasis on more self preserving motivations rather than a grudge against Biden or plans for a 2024 campaign.\n\nAs we know, the relationship between Trump and Russia has been a one sided affair, with Trump praising Putin and engaging foreign policy that would help Russian interests, for example criticizing NATO, and withholding military aid to allies fighting Russia. Trump is going to be in a lot of legal trouble after he leaves office from entities like the New York AG. If Trump stays in the US he will likely be arrested and put on trial, so 2024 run doesn't seem likely. \n\nSo the most probable answer is Trumps final acts as Commander in Chief are a way of  continuing to secure favor with Russia in a bid for an escape plan once he leaves office. By ceding ground in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan Russia is ready to fill the geo-political void with their military presence.",

Thus, everyone is required to contribute via taxes to keep these services running. You can't take from the pot without adding to it, so people who make money in our society (and de facto benefit from these services) for their own personal benefit are required to pay a portion of their income to cover this cost. This also applies to for-profit businesses that are operated to produce profit (income beyond running costs) for private interests.\n\nNon-profits however, are organisations that are operated to provide a service to the public instead of generating personal wealth. The key factor here is a non-profit, as the name suggests, shouldn't be producing profit. Income should all be going back into the organisation and the services it provides. As soon as that money leaves the organisation (i.e. as salaries) it is subject to tax.\n\nSo, knwing this, we can see why the Catholic Church is fundamentally different from Amazon. Church revenue (in theory) goes back into the community and services they provide rather than into the Pope's piggy bank (apart from their salary which is ofc subject to tax, so is irrelevant to your argument).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, are there organisations that maybe circumvent these rules, such as megachurches where pastors buy private jets? Well, possibly, but either way that point actually doesn't support your view in the way you seem to think it does. \n\nSay a pastor purchases a private jet - either they are using an exorbitant income paid out from the church donations (which is unequivocably wrong, unless we're talking a meagre salary that has just been saved for decades - virtually unheard of, but still) or they are somehow able to claim that is a cost related to the services the church provides to it's parishioners. \n\nIn the former instance, your point is rendered moot as that income would be subject to taxation. It's still morally dubious but in regards to taxation, if all personal income taxes are properly paid then there is no issue as far as the state is concerned. \n\nNow to the latter; this would be a failing of regulation, either the regulations themselves are too lax or the tax collection institutions are not doing their job properly. Neither of these are actually an argument that churches should not be tax-exempt, they are reasons that the laws should be refined and processes improved. The good reasons for religious organisations (and other non-profits) being allowed to operate as tax-exempt still exist and are entirely valid regardless of the minority who decide to game the system.",

His employer, whom he signed a voluntary contract with, gave him clear instructions on what his job was. Kaepernick went against his employer's instructions and in doing so, delivered an inferior product to the customers, hurting the brand he represents. \n\nIn that light, it doesn't matter what his opinion was. That wasn't the time or place for him to express it. \n\nThis differs drastically from the Civil Rights movement, which was people, in their own free time, lawfully expressing their opinions. They weren't on the clock. They weren't delivering services to customers. If Kaepernick had, in his own free time, used his fame to get his message across and knelt before a flag, I would have absolutely no issue with it.

LA is not about the crazy sky high buildings and fancy neighborhoods. the culture of LA is extremely diverse, and i honestly don't see how it's boring. as for the punk scene, you're talking about an underground scene... it's not mainstream, you're not going to walk down LA and find punk rock shit everywhere just because you know that LA is where the scene thrived. like someone said in the comments, most punk shit is not visible to the average person, you gotta know people to be exposed to the community. as for the industrial part of LA, it might seem like a bunch of run down buildings, homeless people, etc. but there's way more than to eye can see. i go to underground raves in the industrial district of LA, in those run down buildings. just because an area doesn't look wealthy and nice doesn't mean it's boring and garbage. there are very niche communities that you and i both don't know about. i can speak for living in LA, but not for visiting. although LA is glorified as a tourist location, i honestly think you get a lot more out of LA by actually living there and being exposed to the different cultures and subcultures. i also don't understand why people tend to use such vulgar ass words like \"absolute shithole\" when describing a place they dont like... people live here and like it, many grew up here and value this place a lot. put some respect on LA ! it aint just corporate shit",

No one would treat a cisgender heterosexual in a prejudice manner because they are not sexually attracted to trans people. Quite the contrary in fact.\n\nGenerally it is agreed that all heterosexuals do not have to be attracted to trans people, or that is transphobic not to be. For example, some bi or gay people do not find trans people sexually attractive. The point is though that they don't make a big thing our of it. They don't go around telling people that they are not attracted to trans people because it is hurtful to the trans community to be told that they are not lovable. \n\nSo to clarify:\n\nNo one is saying you *have* to find trans people attractive, there just saying that the fact that you don't is not cause to coin a whole new sexuality.\n\nPeople often think superstraights are acting transphobicly because they are telling an oppressed group (who themselves are deeply scared that no one can love them as themselves) that they are categorically unattractive. \n\nSo even if you are not attracted to trans people, it disrespectful to the trans community to not only broadcast this so vocally, but also be *proud* of it and claim that because you find them so sexually unattractive that you deserve to join their wider community: the lgbtq+ community. \n\nSo because superstraights are literally saying that they should be part of a safe group trans people are part of *because of their lack of attraction to trans people*. I'm sure you can understand why this would cause many trans people to feel threatened and unsafe in the lgbtq+ community. \n\nPeople can be sexually attracted to whoever they like, but superstraights are using their sexuality in a way that can come off as malicious. Because of this most people believe it is better that they just continue to identify as heterosexual, and not attempt to join the lgbtq+ because they are vocally opposed to dating trans people.",

Of course Mao's China is different from Deng's China and I would say that it is Deng who created modern China and Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and this has been expanded by Presidents Jiang, Hu, and now Xi. \n\nC. China has extremely good prospects in the future, China's economy is set to surpass the US economy in 2050, with no signs of stopping. \n\nD. The Chinese quality of life has risen dramatically over the years after the revolution. The average Chinese lifespan has risen from 44.6 in 1950 to to 75.3 years in 2015. The Chinese middle class is growing extremely fast and it is very easy to see. Large brands like Disney, and the NBA are all trying to capture this market. \n\nE. China is extremely good at making deals that benefit both sides. With the Belt and Road initiative and funding projects in Africa, China brings wealth to itself and others. Furthermore, China does not act like global police, drone striking political opponents. \n\nF. China has been at the forefront of the battle against climate change even when other countries has faltered. As of now, China is the world's biggest manufacturer of solar panels and also has the world's largest hydroelectric dam. \n\nBills in China are passed extremely quickly. Hospitals are built in time spans measured in hours, not days, weeks, or months. Entire cities can be shut down, trains stopped, people welded into their houses. No debate is needed when the authorities decide what will happen. \n\nThere is no partisan infighting in China because at the end of the day, everybody wants China to succeed and the President has the ultimate say. \n\nMisinformation and yellow journalism is all but nonexistent in China, the government makes sure that every news source, radio, tv, internet, print, aligns with what the government deems as correct. \n\nI end my case by asking the reader to consider that China is a nation of 1.398 billions souls. A nation with more than 4 times the amount of people as the US. The problems of governance are multiplied the more people there are.

How many countries ranked below \"Flawed Democracy\" do you associate with a thriving economy, reliable infrastructure, or incredible social services?\n\n&gt;They make those decisions and with the wave of a wand everyone has to complete the task.\n\nInefficient resource allocation is literally why planned economies with autocratic governments fail. \n\n&gt;going through private property, getting a bid from a construction company to build the railway,\n\nThe USA could just use eminent domain and state-owned enterprises to overcome these problems. These aren't issues that are inherent or necessary to Democracy, nor are they automatically solved by having an autocracy. \n\n&gt;Their production is through the roof because of their government's ability to make decisions without the consent of their people.\n\nNot really. Plenty of governments are capable of \"making decisions without the consent of the people,\" and yet are nowhere near China in terms of actual production or production capacity.\n\nChina has a massive population, has recently industrialized, and has limited labor rights and protections. This is why their production is through the roof right now. But the Chinese themselves understand that this isn't sustainable forever and that it will end at some time. That's why they're investing in African economies. They anticipate that Africa will industrialize soon and supplant China as the world's factory. \n\n&gt;The positive side of free market capitalism is their ability to innovate.\n\nYou're pretty much explaining to yourself why autocracies won't beat democracies. \n\n&gt;We also can't be forced to do things by the government.\n\nWe can be, though. Democracies have conscription. Democracies have taxes. Democracies have laws. Democracies are fully capable of forcing citizens to do anything. The only hurdle for a democratic government is that a majority of its voting population will have to be in favor of forcing everyone to do something (e.g., if no one wants conscription, voters will elect representatives who oppose conscription and vote out representatives who support conscription, ultimately leading to the end of conscription). \n\n&gt;I believe everyone should have the right to take the vaccine if they want it, and not take the vaccine if they don't want it.\n\nThis might be the case if the only person harmed by refusing a vaccine was oneself. \n\nYou have the \"right\" to deadlift with improper form because the only person who's going to be hurt by your bent back is you.\n\nYou don't have the right to drive at whatever speed you want because your speeding car can kill other people. \n\n&gt;When you give them an inch they will take a mile.\n\n(1) This is a slippery slope fallacy. \n\n(2) This is not directly relevant to the view that you want to have changed. It is possible for a democracy to throw freedoms out the window. You just have to get enough people to want things to be that way. It is also fully possible for an autocracy to be a haven of rights and freedoms. You just have to get someone in power who wants things to be that way.",

This is actually the least relevant thing anyone has ever told me in the context of any conversation that I've ever had. \n\n&gt;I studied the FDA pipeline to \"t\".\n\nSure you did. So, exactly which aspect of the approval process is so deficient and worrying for you?\n\n&gt;But don't force others to take it\n\nI guess we shouldn't be forced to obey traffic laws either, huh?\n\n&gt;They are being cautious for their health\n\nSkepticism for skepticism's sake =/= caution. \n\n&gt;Let the guinea pigs take it and we will find out if it's safe or not.\n\nThis is literally why vaccines go through clinical trials.

Why haven't the vaccinated been dropping like flies? Why haven't the people who were part of those clinical trials last year all come down with some severe, life-threatening side effects? Could it possibly be that vaccines are most likely completely safe and worrying so excessively about them is similar to worrying about coming down with extreme rhabdomyolysis by going for a leisurely walk?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I'd like to end this with a gentle reminder that talking about the vaccine was just one tangential point among eight other things that I brought up.",

Make sense?\n\n&gt;CDC and FDA employees are being vaccinated at a similar rate to the rest of the country.\n\nThe FDA and CDC were one of the first to be offered the vaccine and unrestricted access. The military was also offered the vaccine, and unrestricted access. Meaning my friend is in the military. If you want the vaccine it is offered to them first, any time they want it. They want 100% vaccinated but they aren't required to take it. This is the same with the FDA and CDC.\n\nSo your statement above is disingenuous. Because the general population weren't all offered it unrestricted access. The public were offered it as it became available AFTER the military and other organizations like the FDA and CDC and certain demographical requirements for the general population.\n\nSo your statement is disingenuous.\n\n&gt;How many people have actually been harmed by a given vaccine? How many people have been inoculated with that vaccine?\n\nThis statement assumes the vaccine has been out for 1+ years and has also gone through rigorous testing..... soo... how many people have been harmed by THIS vaccine, the covid-19 vaccine? We don't know yet and won't know yet because there hasn't been proper testing and it has only been about 6 months lol boggles my mind how people like you exist. I guess Darwin was wrong haha\n\nAlso I find it funny our conversation is like this:\n\nMe: Dr. Fauci presented data from the CDC and FDA\n\nYou: That data is flawed. But please read my other data because they fit my narrative better.\n\nMe: I studied chemical engineering and focused on biophysics and studied the FDA drug approval process and have a very sound understanding of the FDA drug pipeline.\n\nYou: that doesn't mean anything\n\nI bring up my Wife and my sister because they see patients daily and have a better understanding of this than the average person. I think you're arrogant for disrespecting our healthcare workers and the general knowledge of medicine and illness.\n\nThere are plenty of virologists who are against the vaccine. The ex-VP of Pfizer is completely against it. The guy who invented the Kary Mullis says using the PCR test to test for viruses is ridiculous because the PCR test will find anything in anyone if you do it certain ways. We've been using the PCR test to test for the virus.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT3IqZjT\\_9A&amp;ab\\_channel=TheDailyExpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT3IqZjT_9A&amp;ab_channel=TheDailyExpose)\n\nBro you're being lied to:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkqQIY7J0fQ&amp;ab\\_channel=BlackPegasus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkqQIY7J0fQ&amp;ab_channel=BlackPegasus)\n\nAsk yourself who is making most money off government funded vaccines? the drug companies.\n\nBefore the pandemic the medical and pharmaceutical industries were notoriously know for being corrupt. All of a sudden once a pandemic started some people believe they are angels.\n\nHere's some logic for you, think about this thoroughly and try to claim it's wrong because this is exactly how the process works in hospitals and clinics:\n\nGuess who are the dirty car salesmen for hospitals: doctors. Doctors prescribe drugs, surgeries and procedures. The more they can prescribe the more money the hospital receives from the insurance companies. They have to stay within legal and medical bounds, but they will push the envelope as much as they can. The more money their hospital makes, then they can receive a raise or bonus.\n\nI told my sister the covid numbers are inflated. All a doctor has to do is check a covid box off and they recieve anywhere from $5,000-$32,000 per patient EXTRA from the government. The CDC had it on their website they gave doctors the authority to claim a patient has covid based on their own opinion. My sister was completely against this idea and talked about the Hippocratic Oath yada yada yada.\n\nMy sister was working on a patient in full PPE gear. The patient was terminally ill from an un-covid related illness. The patient received 2 negative covid test results back. Her supervisor told her she didn't need PPE on anymore for that patient. A few days later that patient passed away. In the notice it said death due to covid. She was shocked not just because of the 2 negative covid test results. But because her supervisor never alerted her of her \"accidental exposure\" to covid. This is a HUGE no-no in the medical field right now because she could spread it to other people in her hospital wing or immuno-deficient patients and essentially take out an entire wing.\n\nShe called me and told me she believes me now.\\\\\n\n&gt;Sure you did. So, exactly which aspect of the approval process is so deficient and worrying for you?\n\nThe fact that it hasn't been through the FDA pipeline yet. lol wuuttttt I think I'm going braindead right now. did you not know this? every drug on the market right now has gone through the 4 steps the FDA has to have a drug on the market. the covid vaccines havent even been through that process yet. LOL\n\n&gt;I guess we shouldn't be forced to obey traffic laws either, huh?\n\nThis statement is like saying \"we have a new traffic light installed sometimes both ways might be green. but it's okay just trust the system. The vaccine hasnt been tested for safety yet bud. I'm not sure how else to explain that to you.\n\nAlso if you have the vaccine you can still carry the virus AND pass it onto others. So you're not saving anyone but other vaccinated people. It doesn't \"slow the spread\".\n\n&gt;Skepticism for skepticism's sake =/= caution.\n\nSo again are you claiming you know more than the FDA? I get it if the drug passed the FDA pipeline and someone was skeptical. sure your statement makes sense. But there are real issues with the vaccine experts and average people are skeptical about. So it isn't skeptical for skeptical sake. You are using the same argument over and over again. Unless you present real data you're grasping at straws. The lack of data is exactly why I am and 10's of millions of others in the u.s. alone are skeptical.\n\n&gt;This is literally why vaccines go through clinical trials. For someone who claims to know so much about vaccine development, it's a little sus that you don't seem to be aware of the fact that establishing the safety of a vaccine is required for a candidate to make it through clinical trials.\n\nlol again it hasn't been through \"clinical trials\" like every other drug that is on the market. this is a disingenuous statement. Especially the fact it isn't FDA approved. You have little to back up your statements except attacking me personally and your very flawed statements like above.\n\n&gt;Beyond this, half of the country has already been vaccinated. Why haven't the vaccinated been dropping like flies? Why haven't the people who were part of those clinical trials last year all come down with some severe, life-threatening side effects? Could it possibly be that vaccines are most likely completely safe and worrying so excessively about them is similar to worrying about coming down with extreme rhabdomyolysis by going for a leisurely walk?\n\nI'm 32. I'm healthy. I have another 40-60 years left of my life. There haven't been long term affects established with the vaccine. Could it be safe? sure. Could it create heart problems and I can't play sports with my new born daughter for the rest of my 40-60 years of life? sure.\n\nPutting those 2 on a weight balance and deciding if taking an untested vaccine is worth it, especially after looking at how innocent the virus is. I'll take my chances without the vaccine. Most people who have problems with the virus are overweight. That's not my problem.",

            "text": "&gt;So I wont inject myself with a untested drug that isn't approved by the FDA. Make sense?\n\nWhat are you even talking about? Which vaccine available in the United States hasn't been tested? They have all gone through clinical trials with satisfactory results. EUA's don't change anything about the safety requirements needed for approval. \n\nThe only difference between a EUA and Approval is in the effectiveness requirement. For an EUA, the FDA only needs to \"reasonably believe\" that the vaccine \"may be effective.\" (e.g., the Pfizer vaccine was given EUA based on an interm 91% effectiveness after phase 3 trials. When that result is finalized, the vaccine will be given full approval). \n\nThe notion that any of the vaccines legally available to you are \"untested\" is actually just batshit. Where the hell did you even get this from?\n\n&gt;So your statement above is disingenuous. Because the general population weren't all offered it unrestricted access.\n\nOkay? How is my statement disingenuous? The FDA and CDC numbers that you're looking at are older than the current numbers I provided for the general population. Meaning they reached that level *before* the general population. \n\n&gt;This statement assumes the vaccine has been out for 1+ years \n\nNo, it doesn't. \n\n&gt;and has also gone through rigorous testing\n\nThey have. That's literally why you're even allowed to get them. \n\n&gt;there hasn't been proper testing\n\nNot sure why you feel the need to continually repeat this lie. \n\n&gt;it has only been about 6 months lol\n\nAnd?\n\n&gt;boggles my mind how people like you exist.\n\nIronic. \n\n&gt;Dr. Fauci presented data from the CDC and FDA\n\nFauci **never** presented any data about vaccination rates among CDC or FDA staff. He literally just gave a guess off the top of his head. The CDC and FDA don't even have any actual data about how many of their employees have been vaccinated. \n\n&gt;I studied chemical engineering and focused on biophysics\n\nThis is a joke, right? You are aware that this is the internet, right? I don't give a shit about whatever qualifications you claim to have. Anyone can hop on reddit and say that they've studied \"x, y, and z\" in university. I don't have proof that you even went to college, much less that you actually studied any of the subjects that you say you did. I don't have any evidence that you even performed satisfactorily in those classes if you actually took them. I don't have evidence that you didn't cheat in those classes. And even having all of these qualifications would not make you infallible. \n\nWhat's to stop anyone from countering your \"qualifications\" by saying that they have a B.S. in biochemistry and a PhD in microbiology and immunology?\n\nYour qualifications are not relevant. I don't care about them and I never will. **The only thing that matters is your ability to actually prove the claims that you make.** \n\n&gt;I bring up my Wife and my sister because they see patients daily and have a better understanding of this than the average person.\n\nSee above. I don't know that you're married or that you have a sister. I don't know that either of them are actually healthcare professionals. Working in healthcare, even being an actual doctor, does not make someone infallible. \n\n&gt; I think you're arrogant for disrespecting our healthcare workers and the general knowledge of medicine and illness.\n\nI think you're significantly overestimating the knowledge that non-immunologists have about immunology. A pediatrician isn't an expert in neurology. An anesthesiologist doesn't need to know a whole lot about immunology. \n\nAlso, \"healthcare professionals\" are not all doctors. Nurses, for example, do not have to be as knowledgeable about anything as doctors. \n\nIt also seems like you aren't aware of the fact that an individual's experiences are not universal. Anecdotes cannot be used to prove broad claims like \"doctors don't want to be vaccinated,\" especially not when *actual data* contradicts the claim.\n\nHere's an example that you might understand better:\n\nI can tell you that I have received the Pfizer vaccine and that I have not had *any* negative side effects. This wouldn't mean much to you for two major reasons:\n\n(1) I could just be lying. \n\n(2) I am just one person. Not every person will react to the vaccine the same way that I did. I might be an outlier. I might have just gotten lucky. Etc. \n\nApply this to your wife, now. I don't care if you say that she's a doctor because:\n\n(1) You could be lying.\n\n(2) She is just one doctor. The hospital that she works in is just one hospital. Other doctors are going to have a different thought process and a different reaction to vaccination. Whatever she thinks and says is not representative of the entire healthcare industry. \n\n&gt;Ask yourself who is making most money off government funded vaccines? the drug companies.\n\nOkay? And this is relevant because?\n\n&gt;All of a sudden once a pandemic started some people believe they are angels.\n\nLmao. Why are you making up strawmen to argue against? This just looks ridiculous. \n\n&gt;Here's some logic for you\n\nLol. \n\n&gt;Doctors prescribe drugs, surgeries and procedures...\n\nDon't care. This is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. I don't need to go to my GP to get a prescription for a vaccine lmao. \n\n&gt;I told my sister the covid numbers are inflated.\n\nProve it. \n\n&gt;My sister was working on a patient in full PPE gear...\n\nAnother anecdote. What happened to the logic?\n\n&gt;The fact that it hasn't been through the FDA pipeline yet\n\nWhich vaccine legally available in the United States hasn't \"been through pipeline?\"\n\n&gt;every drug on the market right now has gone through the 4 steps the FDA has to have a drug on the market. the covid vaccines havent even been through that process yet.\n\nWhat are the four steps that these vaccines haven't been through?\n\n&gt;The vaccine hasnt been tested for safety yet bud\n\nWhich vaccine is legally avaialble in the United States and hasn't been tested for safety yet?\n\n&gt;Also if you have the vaccine you can still carry the virus AND pass it onto others.

I'm sorry if you feel that I have been, and I will make a conscious effort to avoid doing so. But don't complain about feeling attacked by me if you're just going to hypocritically attack me in the same breath. \r\n\n&gt;I'm 32. I'm healthy.\r \n\nAnd we **know** that the coronavirus can kill you. \r\n\n&gt;There haven't been long term affects established with the vaccine.\r\n\nDo you use any medication at all? Why? You don't know if you could experience some unique long term effects. That ibuprofen pill you took might give you a heart attack in 40 years and kill you. \r\n\nHow long are you going to wait before you get vaccinated? Two years? Five years? 10 years? 30 years? 60 years? \r\n\nWith ANY drug/vaccine/etc. that you could take, there is always an infinitesimal chance that some side effect could appear 10, 20, 60 years down the line. But the fact of the matter is that with virtually all vaccines, if there are severe side effects, they typically manifest [within two months](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine) of inoculation.\r\n\n&gt;Could it be safe?\r\n\nIf it's passed phase III, given emergency use authorization, and it's been available for more than two months, then we can say that it is safe.\r\n\n&gt;Could it create heart problems\r\n\nBut we **KNOW** that the coronavirus can create severe health problems for you, and we **KNOW** that vaccination will decrease both the likelihood that you will be infected and the severity of the illness if you do get sick. \n\nIf we dumbed this down to some simple math, this whole argument is like deciding to drink between two cups.\n\nCup 1 contain a poison that we know ***is*** capable of killing people. It has killed people before, and it has killed people who are like you before. \n\nCup 2 contains something that ***may or may*** ***not*** be capable of killing you. We don't know if it can kill you. Many people have drank from this cup, and many of them are like you. But none of them have died. \r\n\n&gt;Putting those 2 on a weight balance and deciding if taking an untested vaccine is worth it,\r\n\nGuess it's a good thing that no one is asking you to take an untested vaccine, then.\r\n\nIf the FDA gives something an emergency use authorization, they have determined that the benefits heavily outweigh the risks (Frankly, the same holds true for approval). \r\n\n&gt;especially after looking at how innocent the virus is\r\n\nBlow it out your ass. The \"innocent virus\" has killed as many Americans as than the American Civil War. \r\n\n&gt;I'll take my chances without the vaccine.\r\n\nAgain, it's not just about you. It's about the people who can't be vaccinated. I don't care if you want to kill yourself. But you aren't the only person being harmed when by a refusal to get vaccinated. \r\n\nThe same way that I don't care if you lock yourself in a garage, with no one else, and turn on your car. But I do care if you decide to go speeding through a school zone. \r\n\n&gt;Most people who have problems with the virus are overweight.\r\n\n[For the average middle-aged adult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7721859/), Covid-19 is significantly more deadly than a flu.

Yourself? \n\n[Levin et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7721859/):\n\n*These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCovid-19 was the third leading cause of death for Americans in 2020. \n\nDo you make an effort to protect yourself from diabetes? \n\nWhat about when you drive? Do you put on your seatbelt? Do you obey traffic laws?\n\nWhat about flying? Do you wear your seatbelt when required and follow instructions given by the aircrew?\n\nDo you get your seasonal flu vaccine?\n\nDo you take cold medicine when you get a cold?\n\nAll of these things are less likely to kill you than Covid-19. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Do I want to inject my arm with an untested vaccine with a 1 out of 45,000 chance I'll die of the virus? No.\n\nIf you want to dumb this down to simple math then why don't you look at the actual numbers?\n\nOf the 32,974,735 Covid-19 cases reported in the United States, 596,686 have been fatal. \n\n**That is a raw mortality rate of 1.8%.** \n\nOf the 151,252,034 fully vaccinated in the United States, 0 have been killed by a vaccine. \n\n**That is a raw mortality rate of 0%.**\n\nNo matter what modifiers you add to the mortality rate of Covid-19, it will always be more dangerous than any of the vaccines that you can legally take in the United States. \n\n&gt;I'm talking about the process that every single drug on the market goes through to be on the market.\n\n**Which vaccine has circumvented this process?** I have asked you several times now and you have yet to even attempt to answer this question. Stop making claims that you can't prove. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I won't read anything that you say after this until after you've read the entirety of my previous comment. If you want to end the conversation here because you don't have the time to read it or actually just don't care enough to read it, that's fine.

Imagine a situation where you have seen your neighbor in walking around your shed in the late morning, and later you find that your chainsaw is missing. So you call the police and accuse your neighbor of stealing it - after all you seen him snooping around your shed and the chainsaw was there  because you have been using it really early in the morning to cut some branches.  \n\n\nBut there is nothing incriminating your neighbor - he does not have chainsaw and swears under oath that he was walking around the shed cause he was thinking of building similar and wanted to see some details. Should he be able to legally put you in jail with the same verdict as for theft?  \n\n\nCause that is exactly what majority of those \"false rape claims\" are - situation where one person accuses other without maliciousness and there is no evidence enough for conclusion.  \n\n\nAnd those rare cases that are malicious, are handled well under current law. After all, no matter how you look at it, false accusation is rarely a same caliber of crime as an actual rape, so it needs to be judged accordingly. \"Eye for an eye\" is a shitty basis to have a legal system based on.",

So I would love to see the people who do the labor of maintaining a property be well paid, whether they are maintenance guys for a large company or small time landlords. The problem is that as long as property is an investment, most of the money generated will go to the person/corporation whose name is on the deed, whether that person does any of the work or not. \n\n&gt;Not every landlord is rich and I imagine a lot of them have bills and loans to pay.\n\nThis would also be solved by paying property managers for their *labor* instead of their *wealth.* A small time landlord would be better off just being paid better for their time. But because we've unnecessarily complicated things by declaring \"ownership\" entitles people/corporations to loads of money, that doesn't happen. You can't get paid a decent wage to manage a dozen apartments because some other corporation will just undercut you and charge less rent, and hire a maintenance guy and pay him $12. If you're a small time landlord you will make less than $12/hr all for the right for society to agree that your name on the deed entitles you to a lot of money in 30 years.

Heck you can get one of those sublease apartments for $425 a month (A 4 bedroom apartment with 4 people all on separate leases). They are actually quite nice. Typically they cater to college students though.\n\nBut let's say $600 a month rent. You spend another $75 on food ($75 + $125 with food stamps means $200 a month. You won't be eating filet mignon but you sure as hell won't starve).\n\nWhat else do you need? Electricity and water is cheap. You can live without a car, cable, internet, telephone. It's not fun but I wouldn't consider those necessities.",

Same thing, just on end-of-year values (or whatever point in time gains are calculated at).  Then...the same carry-forward provision you have today for losses although I think they are uncapped in the wyden plan unlike losses carry-forwards today.\n\nI'm an easy example.  I work in private equity.  Essentially 100% of my income comes in capital gains.  Most of it is tax free or 50% of gains is at income rate and the rest at 0% entirely because of tax programs design to encourage investment in companies that are absurd.  But..lets assume there were special provisions on top of already favorable capital gains then someone who gets a salary has to pay taxes on 100% of what they make each year.  They can't decide to \"not spend it\" and not get taxed.  I make all my money and pay long term capital gains.  So...my \"income\" is taxed less and I can shelter it strategically and so on.

This can reinforce the stereotype of black people being the majority of thieves, even if this isn't true. Let's say your store has 40% black thieves and 60% white thieves, and on your first month by chance you catch 70% black thieves and 30% white thieves. Now you are going to follow black people, and spend a lot of time watching them. This can easily cause you to catch &gt;50% black thieves, because you miss a lot of white thieves while watching black people.\n\nNow, in reality there can be stores where 90% of thieves indeed fit the stereotype and the method might work to catch the most thieves. But you do have to note that because you watch black people more, you will be catching less white people stealing. So a black thief has less chance with you than a white person. And while stealing is simply wrong and it's a good thing you're catching thieves, the white thieves deserve to be caught just as much as black thieves.\n\nThis can also cause disparities later on. If a black person and a white person both decide to go steal something, the black person is much more likely to get caught and get a rep sheet. If this is a one time lapse of judgement, the black person now has a rap sheet and will have a hard time finding a job, while the white person got away with it and can just continue their life without the hardships having to do with a rap sheet, while both the black and the white person were one time thieves. This creates disparity between races in society.\n\nSo there is a practical reason why you might want to use stereotypes, but there are also long term and societal consequences, and I think it would be good to be aware of these, and constantly evaluate your stereotypes and think about if you might need to refocus on possible white thieves some more too.",

Say you swing the election by 100,000 people that way.  Now all of those people are like 'I couldn't vote because I wasn't on the rolls.  But a tone of them would have physical proof that they were on the rolls,  voter id info,  voter cards etc. \n\nEnough would have proof that people would look to see why they were removed,  at which point the hack becomes obvious.\n\nThe fact that this didn't happen shows that your accusation is wrong.  Hillary lost fair and square because America underestimated how much rust belt folks would like a good ol boy over a woman.",

The reason why people focus on high paying careers is because gender disparity in high paying careers has an outsized effect on the relative distribution of power between men and women in society. \n\nWe also *do* see pushes for more women in less lucrative fields than software engineering or the executive suite, but they are obviously less visible because fewer people care about these fields and so this stuff doesn't end up in front of eyeballs. Think about how you'd learn about various gender disparity initiatives. Are you hearing about them direct from employers or professional organizations? Or are you hearing about them from news media and social media? The latter is not an exhaustive thing and is often deliberately skewed in its vision to aggravate you.\n\nMy brother in law is an electrician.
