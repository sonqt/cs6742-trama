They like their simple, comfortable world with bad guys and good guys. Many democrats have a myopic and simplistic view of the world too, but it is less erroneous (anti-GMO/vaccine/nuclear zealots notwithstanding).\n\nAfter spending years arguing with leftists on reddit, I can tell you that the vast majority of them have a view of the world that is almost entirely based on emotional pleas, baseless assertions and sometimes prejudice against white people, old people, rich people, or republicans.\n\n&gt;A depressing amount of republicans hate liberals and educated people such as university professors. They refuse to believe that higher learning truly is valuable and do not accept that the \"liberal elites\" are more qualified to make policies than they are.\n\nWhat republicans hate is elitism. They hate a few people confidently imposing rules from the top down on millions of people. Universities have become a pretty strong figurehead for that, and for liberal elitism in general, with professors being wildly leftwing. If you don't believe that liberal policies work, why would you believe liberal elites are more qualified to make policies? Isn't that the issue? That they don't agree with them?\n\n&gt;Not only that, but they resent and despise those more literate and informed than they are and care more about settling imaginary scores with their caricatural views of them than anything else.\n\nRepublicans are probably not interested enough in intellectualism, and liberals are far far far too obsessed with the appearance of it. What matters is if the ideas are better, and so far none of what you're saying is about ideas. You're just attacking people with vague insults.\n\n&gt;A substantial amount of republicans AND, to a lesser degree, democrats cannot distinguish between baseless smears/fake news and facts.\n\nBecause they've been basically locked out by a media and academia that are left leaning beyond normalcy given the general population and beyond what is reasonable to conclude about the issues. Where do you want them to go when the \"credible\" and \"official\" channels are either lying to them, or giving them propaganda, or at best giving them a liberal-biased version of whatever it is they're telling them?\n\n&gt;Republican politicians are in the pockets of the wealthy and truly do not care if the poor die in the street or if the middle class is destroyed. Their behavior is evil by their own moral standards. Only the rich and their immediate family and friends truly matter to them.\n\nI mean come on. Are you even being serious here? You're assigning motive to people you know nothing about. I'm waiting for where in your post you actually make *arguments* instead of slinging hyperbolic insults with nothing to back it up.\n\n&gt;Over 33% of the population are willing to tolerate racism as long as it's not aimed at them. This number percentage is significantly higher amongst white people.\n\nCan you provide a source for this? I'm having trouble understanding what point you're trying to make. It seems very contrived and not really relevant. It wouldn't surprise me if white people care less about racism in general than minority groups.\n\n&gt;the election of Donald Trump.\n\nwhich is a result of posts like this.\n\n&gt;the inexorable economic decline of industrial rural america.\n\nWhich is due to technology and automation, none of the insults you just made about republicans.\n\n&gt;the countless comments and insults I've seen hurled at liberals (liberals don't have equivalents to libtard or cuck or behavior such as \"rolling coal\").\n\nYou just wrote a huge post dedicated to calling republicans racists and stupid. And if you think leftwing phrases like that don't exist, go visit /r/politics\n\n&gt;Vote tallies for Donald Trump, who has made countless racist, sexist and bigoted comments, exhibited racism in a documented fashion (housing discrimination).\n\nAnother example of republicans being less likely to care about the appearance of these things. Donald trump was an extremely unliked candidate, even when he was elected. This says that republicans voted for him pragmatically, despite those things. Maybe you think saying stupid shit should automatically disqualify you no matter what, but obviously people disagree with you. That doesn't make them racist, sexist or bigoted.\n\n&gt;People who vote republican despite the fact it is factually against their own interest (repealing obamacare, tax cuts for the rich are harmful according to the CBO).\n\nDo you not get the irony? You are the *perfect* example of what they hate. You just said that repealing obamacare is factually against their interest. How in the fucking **world** do you call that a fact? How in the fucking **world** are you going to claim it's a fact that cutting taxes (for basically everybody) is going to be against their own interest. You realize the CBO is only looking at the *budget*, right? That it's not looking at all possible direct and indirect effects of having a low tax, low regulation environment? This is a great example of what's wrong with the left's obsession with the appearance of facts and intellectualism. The CBO has numbers, and numbers are good! Therefore if the CBO says something bad about something, it's a FACT that it's bad. No, in reality, you don't really understand the issue well enough and you're blindly following some group that you put trust in.",

            "text": "I'm sorry, but people who think lab grown meat is a \"thing\" unfortunately have little experience in biological cell culture and have only been duped by reading non-scientific articles in newspapers like The New York Times and magazines like Wired about it. Maybe someone from the industry can correct me, but here's why I think it's (currently) BS due to the limitations of 2D cell culture, cell doubling time, reagent cost, and reagent sourcing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe #1 problem with lab grown meat is the throughput of standard cell culture techniques used by every biology lab around the world. All these labs are growing their cells on [flasks of various sizes](https://www.usascientific.com/productimages/greiner/main/advanced-tc-filter-flasks-m.jpg) but a very common one is a T75 flask, meaning it has 75 cm^(2) on which to culture cells. From a single T75 flask you can maybe get a max of 10 million cells, and that's pushing it. 10 million cells may sound like a lot, but consider that the average person is around 75 trillion cells, and you can start to see a problem. The sheer number of cells to even make a \\*single\\* patty is on the scale of billions of cells. Since 1 billion cells roughly fills up a 50 mL tube, I'd say a decent single patty requires around 2 billion cells - so 200 standard T75 flasks for one patty. A \\*typical\\* student or researcher is going to be changing cell media in anywhere from 1-20 flasks for his or her research. A full time lab tech who is paid by a department may be taking care of many many more flasks at a time for something like stem cell culture, but you only bother to hire a lab tech when you have so many dozens to hundreds of flasks to take care of that it would prevent your PhD students from getting any actual research done other than changing cell media. So producing just \\*one patty\\* of 2 billion cells from 200 flasks is basically going to require that you hire a full time lab tech to take care of the cells and grow them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you're serious about growing this patty and you ditch the T75 flasks and get something more efficient like a [cell factory](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LCD/product-images/LC-120300-NuncCO2-Incubator_04.tif-650.jpg) where you just stack larger flasks in a gigantic incubator. Doing that still won't change current limitations of 2D culture, cell doubling time, reagent cost and reagent source. Since we still culture cells in 2D, it's horribly inefficient in comparison to growing cells in 3D, greatly limiting the efficiency and yield. So why don't we just grow our cells in 3D? After all it'd help all biologists to have billions of cells to work with instead of millions, right? The problem here is the diffusion of oxygen to cells in the flasks. The typical distance thrown around for the diffusion limit of oxygen is 200 microns. Beyond this distance oxygen cannot diffuse far enough to keep cells alive and you need vasculature like capillaries to be carrying oxygen to your cells. So if you want to start culturing cells in 3D in \"tissues\" thicker that just 1/5 of a mm deep, you need to be creating some sort of vasculature to provide your cells with oxygen and nutrients. Creating 3D vasculature for cells is my area of research, so all I can say is good luck doing that on a massive scale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you've got the cell factory, lab tech, and have maybe even found a way to start culturing cells in roughly 3D volumes, awesome! That won't change the doubling time of your cells, or the cost of your reagents or your reagent source. Cells can only multiply so quickly to fill up your culture flasks. A C2C12 cell (a super common mouse muscle cell) doubles roughly every 12 hours. So currently every couple of days you need to take that one full flask of cells and \"split it\" into, say, 4 flasks of cells to give them more room to grow. If you find a way to lower the doubling time of the cells, you are going to have to be \"splitting\" your cells into flasks even more frequently, which takes more time than just changing the cell media you're feeding them with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you've got the cell factory, lab tech, have found a way to start culturing cells in roughly 3D volumes and have a cell line with a really fast doubling time. That won't change the cost of your reagents or your reagent source. So all those flasks you were growing your cells in require cell media. Cell media is just the broth that contains crucial proteins and nutrients cells need to grown outside of a normal body. As cells proliferate, they consume the nutrients in the media, turn it acidic and need it changed every so often. It's basically food and a diaper in one. You need to provide the cells with food, and you can't let the media get too acidic (dirty) so it needs to be changed. The problem with all of this cell culture stuff is that cell media is expensive. A single T75 flask takes maybe 20 mL of cell media at a time. So to get your 2 billion cells from 200 T75 flasks, you need 4L of media just to start the experiment. Around 500 mL of [C2C12 cell media](https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/US/en/Primary-and-Stem-Cells/p/000000000000185301/SkGM-Skeletal-Muscle-Cell-Growth-Medium-BulletKit) is going to run you at least $160, maybe less if you order in bulk as a company, but either way for your first round of cell media you're looking at 8 x $160 = $1280 for your first 4L of cell media. Keep in mind you'll probably have have to change this media at least once while your cells are doubling in all those flasks, so make it $2560. Throw in your tech's salary, CO2 costs, electricity costs to run your incubators and you're looking at maybe another $1000. **So it's \\~$3500 just to get your single patty.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you've got the cell factory, lab tech, have found a way to start culturing cells in roughly 3D volumes, have a cell line with a really fast doubling time and are okay paying a lot for cell media. This doesn't change **the ultimate final problem** **with cell culture - it depends on the slaughterhouse industry to even exist.** What am I talking about, you ask? Well where did you think all that cell media came from? One of the most crucial reagents in cell culture is [Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum). It is literally the blood taken from an unborn calf whose mother was slaughtered. Serum is the fluid component of blood that contains all those small proteins needed to culture cells, and a developing fetus contains loads of those precious, precious proteins. So to even have started this experiment you were indirectly buying the blood of unborn cows to even get to your patty and therein lies the ultimate irony - **the lab grown meat industry needs to industrial slaughter industry to even exist.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to your point of \" If this tech was prioritized and funded I can see a more sustainable agriculture future for humanity.\" The problem is is that this tech is and has always been prioritized by biologists ever since we started culturing cells decades ago. Additionally, it has always been \"funded\" but how much (more) is needed? Well it's difficult to say. Scientific research is slow. You do not necessarily solve problem A faster by throwing more money at it. This is because problem A is also dependent on current limitations of technology B. And technology B is hindered by limitations in method C. All these fields of scientific research are intertwined so typically an advance in one technology has a positive ripple effect into other areas. The downside to this is that even if you spend 10x more money on cell culture research than you currently are, you are not going to solve all the associated problems of cell culture. The thought that you can throw more money at research and solve all problems faster is to assume 9 pregnant women can produce a baby in 1 month. It is simply not true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat \\*could\\* make lab grown meat possible? Finding a way to produce all of those proteins like FBS \\*in vitro\\* just like we produce insulin for diabetics with modified bacteria. If there was a company that was able to produce cell culture media without the need for FBS, or found a way to make FBS synthetically, I would invest in it. That company would then provide at least one of the key limiting reagents needed for cell culture. But you're not going to see a NYT article about \"company creates synthetic FBS substitute\" because no one outside of the field would know what that is and what it implies. It is instead far more easy for the NYT or Wired to go to one of these \"lab grown meat\" companies, look at all their culture flasks and say \"wow this is the future\". Well it's currently not the future in my eyes, it's just a very time and cost inefficient way of growing you one patty and until the handful of limitations I mentioned above are addressed, it will continue to be BS.",

            "text": "So if cells double in 12 hours, the total target for the cell quantity you need to have in the system at any one time is the local consumption in any given 12 hour period in the area that you are growing for. Say you own South Texas Clean Meat company which grows and distributes meats to 10,000,000 people who consume on average 200grams every 12 hours, you\u2019d need around 2,000 tonnes of culture \u2018brewing\u2019 at any time, producing 2,000 tonnes of meat every 12 hours. You could probably do this in a single large facility and although not specified in your post i am going to assume it would consume roughly 4000 tonnes of \u2018feed\u2019 per 2000 tonnes created. \n\nConsider then for a moment what this replaces. Let\u2019s break it down as:\n500 tonnes of chicken, 500 tonnes Lamb, 1000 tonnes beef. \n\nAt 1kg meat per chicken, this is 500,000 chickens every 12 hours or 1,000,000 per day. Meat chickens take roughly 40 days to grow, process and distribute meaning you\u2019d need 40,000,000 chickens in the pipeline. At 10,000 chickens per hectare (free range) this is 4,000HA of land. At 115g of food per chicken per day, you also need 4,600Tonnes of chicken food per day or around 9.2kg of feed per kg of meat produced. You also have to manage around 4,000 tonnes of guano per day and dispose of 1,000,000 carcasses. \n\nFor beef, to produce 1,000 tonnes per 12 hours, and assuming an average of age of 2 years and weight of 1000kg at slaughter, producing roughly 500kg of saleable meat in various cuts you need 4,000 beasts per day with around 3,000,000 in the pipeline. Each consumes 3% of its bodyweight in food per day so you need around 45,000 tonnes of feed per day to produce that beef (possibly more, as I have assumed linear growth from 0 to 1000kg over 2 years). Assuming they all live on feedlots (yes I know, many are grass fed, but this brings its own issues) and are stocked at around 500 per hectare you need 6,000 hectares of land. You also have to handle 40,000 tonnes of cow pat and 4,000 carcasses per day. This is currently dumped in rivers and streams at huge cost to the environment. \n\nJust to reiterate, we feed chickens 9.2 times as much grain as they produce in meat and cows 23 times as much grain as they produce in meat!!\n\nThis new meat is so much more efficient at scale that we only harm ourselves by _not_ throwing money at solving the problems you raise (some of which I would wager are already solved). I love eating animal but if I could have the same taste and nutrition without the slaughter? FUCK YES. Maybe lab grown meat isn\u2019t much of a thing today, but it is definitely the future of meat. All I can say is if you\u2019re not solving the problems, get out of the way. \n\n",

That\u2019s not something I\u2019m willing to stand for, I will stand for all lives and equality of opportunity for all people. All the progress we have made towards that is blatantly ignored. Over the last 20 years police shootings have dropped quite a bit especially when comes to blacks. Black people have more opportunities than ever. And that brings me back to my poor black \u201cfriend\u201d who thinks I\u2019m privileged. I scored higher on every part of the ACT than him, was a much better student in high school while he barely graduated. Yet when we both applied to the same school for the same major, he gets accepted and a scholarship, and I get declined. So yeah I think blacks need to stop using the victim mentality and realize that 99.99999% of white people don\u2019t care that your black and could even be your friend. And that they have so many opportunities these days. The majority of there problems comes from there own culture holding them back not other cultures.",

And they never say what they want just to stop racism. How about they stop saying black culture is perfect and doesn\u2019t turn out kid after kid who thinks they need to be a thug or gangster to be accepted.

It's just a convenient way to say that someone isn't transgender, i.e. that their gender identity matches the sex they were born with. Also, you're creating a double standard here. The way you see it, trans people have the right to decide which pronouns people should use to refer to them, but under the condition that cis people should have both the right to decide which pronouns people should use to refer to them (cis people) *and* the right to prohibit other people from calling them *cisgender*. Sure, both are ultimately connected to how you address someone, but you're still giving cis people greater rights.\n\n&gt;People who are trans are trans, people who are not trans don\u2019t need a label equal to identify them as not trans. They are just not trans, the default alignment.\n\nAre you also annoyed by the term *heterosexual*, since that's the \"standard\" and \"normal\" sexual orientation, which, therefore, also shouldn't need a label? How about *able-bodied*? Is that also a bad expression, since people who are not disabled are \"normal\" and don't need a label?\n\n&gt;Stop giving things in the norm names and labels as if to say \u201cthe choice is your trans or cis it matters not\u201d when it does.\n\nThat's not why *cisgender* exists and I think you know that. Literally no one is claiming that you can choose whether you're cis or trans, so the term is not a representation of such a belief.\n\n&gt;MOST people are what you call \u201cCis\u201d what I call normal. And if calling it normal offends trans people, that\u2019s fine.\n\nYou can drop the \"if\" from that second sentence. You know very well that if you call cis people *normal*, that means that trans people are *abnormal*, and that specific term is a term with strong negative connotations that offends people. I've never heard *abnormal* being used as a neutral or positive term when describing someone. Also, like I've implied earlier, why use that term only when talking about gender? Most people are heterosexual. Are non-heterosexuals *abnormal*? Most people are also not disabled. Are disabled people *abnormal*? Also, you can't preach about mutual respect and then imply it's perfectly fine to insult trans people by calling them *abnormal*. And also also, once again, you're trying to establish a double standard: it's fine when you use a negative term to describe trans people, but you have every right to be annoyed when they use *cisgender* to describe you, although that is a term that is not negative in any way.\n\n&gt;Stop defining the norm as equal to the anomaly.\n\nAre you sure *cisgender* does that? It's simply a descriptive term, not a term that states any sort of value judgment.\n\n&gt;Nothing I just said is phobic of anything, if you think it is that\u2019s very much a you problem.\n\nYes, what you've said is transphobic and you're aware of that, which is why you've preemptively tried to label it as not transphobic. If you believe it's just fine to describe a trans person with negative or insulting terms, while you wouldn't dream of describing a cis person the same way, that's transphobic, since it implies that trans people deserve to be treated more poorly or with less respect than cis people just because they're trans. And if you feel offended that I've called one of your ideas transphobic, that's very much a you-problem.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s not a Cis-gendered heteronormative world view, it\u2019s the common view of man.\n\nIt's common because most people are cisgender and heterosexuals. That doesn't mean we shouldn't label it or that it's perfect or that we shouldn't question it or introduce new elements into it or that it is universally embraced or that there are no alternative viewpoints. Also, calling it \"the common view of man\" almost makes it sound like those who don't share it are somehow not a part of human race.\n\n&gt;trying to change the way everyone else sees the world to make space for you is really entitled\n\nOh, you want to talk about entitlement? Isn't it, generally speaking, cishet people, rather than LGBT people, who feel entitled to describe their sexuality and relationships as superior? Aren't cishet people those who have jailed, assaulted, murdered, fired, banned marriage and adoption to and created \"conversion\" programs for those who are sexually not like them due to an unjustified sense of superiority and entitlement?

No. it just bugs me. so why do u care if i call you something your not? you don't mind doing it to me.\n\n&gt; Yes, what you've said is transphobic and you're aware of that, which is why you've preemptively tried to label it as not transphobic. \n\ni stand by this to my dying breath. if you took what i said, or said above as a dislike, hatred, or devaluation of trans-people. thats becuase you read it in their. the worst i said was a cold disinterest, and a desire to be left alone by the whole thing.

It is an incredible waste of resources and human effort to try to establish a colony on a dead world just because we MAY be able to.\n\nLiterally everything on the colony will come from Earth, which means massive amounts of resource extraction are necessary. We're already destroying life on Earth extracting incredible quantities of resources for computers, cell phones, cars, batteries, etc. All the materials used for consumer goods will become even more expensive and progressively more difficult to extract. We can see this is already the case with fossil fuels. Soon enough coltan, lithium, copper, and the literally hundreds of other nonrenewable substances that go into modern tech will be just as difficult to source. Eventually under our current governing philosophy they will effectively run out or be prohibitively expensive to extract. So we should focus on moving away from these entirely, or recycling what we have, rather then plotting a course for the future which assumes massive expansion of extraction until the resources are exhausted.\n\nThe human cost of extracting these resources for trivial uses is already unconscionabe. Doubly so to put a few people on another planet. Considering the terrible suffering and waste involved in acquiring, refining, and manufacturing with them, these resources shouldn't be used the way they are currently (planned obsolescence in everything, yearly upgrades, rich people's toy electric cars) much less in an even more aggressive way which indefinitely removes them from the planet.\n\nYou're for destroying and abandoning Earth?

That isnt selfish, the people there have seen how it has negatively affected their communities causing meth problems and child abuse\n\n&gt; For instance, supply side economics (which states the government should have as little involvement in the economy as possible) is illogical because we have witnessed how government intervention brought us out of a depression and a recession,\n\nYes, we got out of stagflation by Reaganomics, we got out of that absurdly bad recession in March 2020 by calming down and not overreacting (we have 80-90% recovered since then), while the Great Depression and 2008 were so mismanaged that it took 16 years and 8 years to recover. That is just proof of how supply side economics works\n\n&gt; not to mention how government provides a safety net for vulnerable citizens (i.e. food stamps, FDIC insurance, unemployment) \n\nGet rid of a safety net and replace it with spikes sticking up and you encourage people to not fall - to not do stupid stuff that causes failure. Ever see how Chinese people save money? They save every single last penny that they do not need to spend. We need to encourage that in our society, and they did that by having people starve to death if they were not wise with money in the great leap forward, then passing that on to their children. \n\nDont blow your rent on sneakers, beer, and that mustang you got on an 84 month loan at 21%\n\n&gt; Other illogical conservative policies include championing the welfare of a clump of cells in the womb, but not the baby once it is born\n\nAdoption has a 7 year wait list, to say that they dont care after it is born is absurd. \n\n&gt;  advocating for the rights of people to own guns who have a history of violence or mental illness and thus are threats to society\n\nNope, having a history of violence has disqualified you from owning guns since 1938, and being involuntarily committed since 1968. We are advocating the right to not issue warrants to shoot the wives and children of gun owners on sight because of manufactured evidence (Ruby Ridge)\n\n&gt; supporting corporate welfare over the welfare of American citizens. \n\n\"corporate welfare\" virtually always just means low interest loans.

So one, we are really poorly made creatures that can't even tell that we're breathing in oxygen; instead the mechanism relies on CO2 concentration, which is what my comment on logical leaps was about (you did make them, paraphrasing - just because plants breathe CO2, it must also be okay for humans - big logical leap). Two, in response to the change in topic, it is unrelated to our breathing in of CO2 via which it affects the climate. Read those links for a short summary, but plenty of things in small quantities and concentrations are dangerous and we should be worried by the large relative change in concentration (which is what our concern is about funnily enough).\n\nCan you, in response, explain why you **do not** think such a large relative change in the concentrations of our atmosphere would not have an effect on the climate? Is it scientific illiteracy, poor education, bad teaching, ignorance or stupidity that misinforms your opinion? I would honestly like to know, I've only ever met one other person in denial about the science and they were a conspiracy theorist. It's always good to get a larger statistical pool to inform my understanding of this line of thought.\n\nNot matter your response (or non-response) I want you to understand that this is provable science, even if you do not comprehend it does not negate the truth.

YOU made that assumption, and poorly, calling it a \u2018logical leap\u2019 that you assume I\u2019d made. I didn\u2019t. You were grabbing at straws to discredit my argument because it disagrees with yours. \n\nYour links were written by leftists who agree with your position. You presented them only due to confirmation bias. \n\nAs for the science, it\u2019s quite simple. CO2 was found in a much larger concentration many thousands of years ago. During the Paleozoic Era, the average CO2 concentration was about 1600ppm, or 0.16%, 4 times what it is today. Yet the average annual temperature wasn\u2019t much different than today, within 1 degree Celsius. The Earth has cycles is goes through, some of which last decades. There have been ice ages, and periods of warming, followed by ice ages again. Our orbit around the sun changes too, affecting all of this.\n\nThe climate is constantly changing, gradually. It always will. None of it is human-caused. Do we as humans have an impact? Sure, but a small one, and nothing the planet can\u2019t shrug off. Regardless of how you feel about the science, there are a few things that are irrefutable:\n\n1- Assuming CO2 is the culprit, and reducing it would lower the Earth\u2019s temperature, doing the math says it would take more than 30 years of ZERO global emissions to reduce the average annual temperature by 1 degree Celsius. This will never happen. Too many countries (China) will never curtail theirs. In truth the U.S. is one of the cleanest, not the dirtiest as the media would have you believe. China and India are the current worst offenders.\n\n2- It doesn\u2019t matter whether either one of us can prove our science on this. It\u2019s questionable for one big reason: you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to believe that paying more taxes, and giving the government (any government) more money to throw at the problem, will do anything to fix it. If the governments of the world (U.S. included) have proven one thing, it\u2019s that they\u2019re grossly inept at solving the world\u2019s problems. \n\n3- Follow the money. See who profits from \u2018climate change\u2019. See who\u2019s looking to get more control over segments of the economy.\n\n4- Nothing we\u2019re currently doing has any impact at all. EV\u2019s are a joke. Hybrids are a joke. There isn\u2019t a single hybrid or EV that can ever recover through fuel savings, the carbon emissions expended during it\u2019s manufacture, transportation to market, and use during it\u2019s lifespan on the road. This is true for just the batteries ALONE, never mind any other part, or the whole car itself. Every EV uses electricity generated by fossil fuels. \n\n5- Fossil fuels are still the most cost-effective energy source in existence, and it\u2019s not even close. It takes over 25 lbs. of lithium-ion batteries to equal the potential energy in 1 gallon of gas (which weighs only 7 pounds). EV\u2019s are cute and novel, but still far from practical for anything more than short-range or intracity travel.",

He was too young to own or buy a gun, so he knowingly had his friend do it for him.

He was let off of his charges bc of an insanely irresponsible and dumb law/legal loophole. The actual law may be on his side, and he may have even been justified in the actual case of self defense once the violence started, but all of these other factors contributed to what went down that day. Factors that were caused by him. HE went to Kenosha. HE had his friend buy him a gun. HE went to the protest WITH the gun.
